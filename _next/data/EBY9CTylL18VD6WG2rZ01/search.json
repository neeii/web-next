Conduct research Our work is a result of more than a decade of applied research and collaboration with atrisk communities and human rights defense organizations around the world. Why this work matters People armed with smartphones are history's first responders, amassing rich, contextualized records of injustice and fostering unprecedented demand for change. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media. Our phones are replaceable but the moments we capture on them are not. Many activists, journalists, and eyewitnesses are storing precious pieces of history on the most fragile devices they own. The media itself is also ephemeral, as new threats to digital media arise. Who we are OpenArchive is a team of archival activists dedicated to protecting media freedom: preserving, amplifying, and securely routing mobile media to communitymaintained collections in accessible public and private archives, beyond the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.

OpenArchive is an experienced research, usability, and development team dedicated to protecting media freedom by helping eyewitnesses preserve truth to power. We’ve created a distributed media archiving ecosystem that enables human rights defenders to share, archive, verify, and encrypt their evidentiary media. We conduct coresearch, build tools, and create guides that advance human rights every day. Created by and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders in 2015, OpenArchive fosters a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history. What is Save? Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) is a free, opensource, securemobile application built with and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders. Save securely sends mobile media to the Internet Archive and other online and offline destinations using Orbot/Tor. OpenArchive unites the work of the Guardian Project, Creative Commons, Tor, and distributed secure servers. It offers atrisk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored for longterm access and reuse. Save helps you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while ensuring your identity remains protected. It's also freely available for iOS and Android. With Save, you can add metadata and Creative Commons licensing to your audio or visual mobile media, then send it over TLS and the privacyfocused Tor network to the Internet Archive or other private archives to be saved. Save protects free speech by leveraging a suite of privacyenhancing technologies to safeguard your media and identity in the event of internet shutdowns, surveillance, device confiscations, content takedowns, limited bandwidth, and data loss. It also assures continued access to your saved media for years to come. What can Save do? Save is committed to usability and digital inclusion. Unlike other mediasharing tools, it offers responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on participatory research and codesign with communities we serve. With Save you can: Authenticate Media: With Save, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media. Secure Transit: Save always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure intransit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice. LongTerm Preservation: When you use Save to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to longterm media preservation. Licensing: With Save you can communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a Creative Commons license inapp allowing others to reuse or modify your work. Stay Organized: Save's easytouse design allows teams and individuals to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders specific to each contributor. Add Metadata: Save lets you add metadata like location, people, and notes to your archived media. Flag Significant Content: You can flag certain media as “significant” to alert reviewers that this folder contains sensitive/violent media or just use it as a “favorites” folder. Import Media: Save allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdf files. Improve Redundancy: With Save you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by who you want. View Progress: When storing media via Save, you can view how much content has been uploaded. Prioritize Uploads: prioritize particular media to upload first over others (e.g., order the smallest files first and largest files last). What can't Save do? Although Save offers a suite of many unique features, it’s no silver bullet. When using the app, please be aware of the following limitations: Save does not provide storage or server space: You will need to set up your own WebDavcompatible server (such as Nextcloud, etc.), or use the Internet Archive (free) or DropBox to create and store your collections. Save does not provide ondevice encryption: Save does not store your media; it only stores thumbnails from your camera roll, which are not currently encrypted in the app. Once organized into projects and uploaded to the server, all media is sent over an encrypted connection. We recommend that you also encrypt your server for enhanced security. Save does not delete original copies of media from your camera roll: Once media is sent to a server, you can then delete the thumbnails from the Save app if you choose. The original content will remain in your camera roll (unless you remove it). Save does not have an inapp killswitch: Uninstalling Save will remove all local copies of media/metadata stored in the app and all local configurations and settings, including account information. Is OpenArchive the Internet Archive? No, OpenArchive collaborates with the Internet Archive, but is an independent project. The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library offering free universal access to books, movies, and music, as well as almost a trillion archived web pages. OpenArchive is a project dedicated to the ethical collection and longterm preservation of mobile media. Save (share, archive, verify, encrypt) is the mobile application we’ve created to do this. Save enables people to send media to multiple places, including the Internet Archive and other destinations of their choice. This option also enables people to create public or private media collections. Why not social media? Although social media platforms are an easy place to house photos and videos, these platforms lack critical security safeguards and are subject to state censorship and content takedowns from the companies themselves. Use Save to avoid these pitfalls: Social media often exposes atrisk sources: Although major social media platforms can amplify content by exposing it to a large audience, these platforms can also expose sources to unwanted identification. Individuals shown or otherwise implicated in videos, photos, or audio clips may be targeted both online and offline. Social media can make it difficult to authenticate or verify media: Social media sites often strip metadata (info about where and how media was captured) from uploaded content. While this feature enhances privacy, the practice also makes media authentication and verification more difficult. Media gets lost on social media platforms: Within a sea of content, it is difficult to contextualize or organize media for easy access in the future. Social Media is not committed to longterm preservation: Companies moderate content, take down media, and go out of business. Who is Save for? We designed Save with and for individuals and organizations across the globe, including: Human rights organizations collecting evidence of abuse; Academic organizations accepting targeted or sensitive media from the field; Journalists and news organizations receiving sensitive media from vulnerable sources whose identity and personal details must be protected from interception; Archivists and librarians working to create community collections at the Internet Archive or other digital libraries; and Individuals, freelance documentarians, and citizen journalists/eyewitnesses interested in organizing and curating their own mobile media collections. Why use Save by OpenArchive? Save helps combat common threats, including: Loss of data: Both digital and analog data face ongoing threats, (e.g. theft, manipulation, surveillance, sabotage, or intentional destruction), loss (e.g. hard drive failure or misplaced USB stick), and incidental destruction (e.g. natural disaster, waterbased damage, or mold). Save helps protect against these threats by providing a way to create multiple backups of important data and distribute them across geographically and jurisdictionally diverse servers. Single point of failure: Keeping data in just one place increases the likelihood that any of the above scenarios may lead to an inability to use or access your data. With Save, you can connect and send media to multiple storage servers so that if one fails, the data will still be available elsewhere. Network surveillance and censorship: People often want to protect their content, identity, and/or activities from those who may be watching them (like governments, private companies, or untrustworthy individuals). Save hardens your network connection by always employing TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the Tor network via Orbot (for Android, iOS coming soon), which promotes privacy by encrypting data transfers and protecting against traffic analysis. Inauthentic or unverified content: Unverified content can lead to false conclusions and damage credibility. Save always uses SHA256 hashes and incorporates ProofMode (for Android, coming soon for iOS), a feature that supports robust verification and authentication practices. How can I support OpenArchive?

It seems every few minutes there is yet another news alert or push notification about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of troops are closing in on Ukraine, with explosions reported in Kyiv and other cities. The multipronged assault is an act of military aggression that hasn’t been seen in Europe in decades. Ukraine once again is pushed into the spotlight of imperial interests and debate.So how did we get here? The history is complex, and not easy to fit into a headline or Tweet, so navigating the news and updates surrounding Ukraine can be a challenge for those who aren’t already invested. We spoke to Eastern Europe editor for Global Voices Dr. Tanya Lokot on how to read the news around the conflict. Lokot, who is Ukrainian herself, has been a Global Voices contributor since 2013. Lokot’s research predominantly focuses on the role of digital media in postSoviet Europe. Here are some tools to help you look beyond the headlines: Navigating the news around Russia's attack on Ukraine Understand The Historical Context First Like any global conflict, the tension between Russia and Ukraine did not happen overnight. “Don't just think of it as a board game where things are moving every day on the chessboard,” Lokot said. “It's not really just about how many thousands of troops are at the border, but it's trying to understand well, where does this all come from?” Ukraine was part of  or occupied by, depending on who is telling the story – the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union for centuries before regaining independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR. There have been tensions between Ukraine’s old ties with Russia and its allegiances with the West ever since. Timeline of Russia's attack on Ukraine In 2014, Ukrainians took to the streets and toppled proRussian president Viktor Yanukovych, demanding their independence and sovereignty. The Russian government meanwhile has consistently held the position that Ukraine is part of Russia. In 2014, Russian troops invaded Donbas and annexed Crimea, the biggest land grab in Europe since World War II. Today we see the escalation of war and the threat of further invasion of Ukraine.While Ukraine is the subject of the conversation, its people aren’t often centered in media reporting, which instead focuses on geopolitics between Russia and the U.S. and other Western European countries. “Ukraine is a country that has fought for recognition as a state for many, many years. And it's always been kind of smooshed in between these various imperial powers,” Lokot said. Lokot suggests people listen to more Ukrainian voices and sources when trying to understand the issue. “Understand why Ukrainians are so upset about somebody else trying to make decisions for them and why are they also upset when it's being framed as a conflict between Russia and NATO or Russia and the West? It's like, well, what about us?” For more historical context, Lokot suggests checking out the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, which has online resources and guides on the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House also offers helpful insight on the political dynamics of Ukraine. What To Consider When Reading U.S. and Other Foreign Media American journalists have been put into the awkward position of trying to explain the United States’ role in Ukraine while contending with the country’s dark past in getting involved in other global conflicts. “I think this colors both what U.S. officials say and how they say it and also how the U.S. media is reporting it,” Lokot said. In Afghanistan, the U.S. showed itself to be inept at combating corruption and insurgency. President Joe Biden’s perceived diplomatic failure in Afghanistan after pulling out the rest of the American troops now hovers over the media coverage in Ukraine as well. Western, particularly U.S. media, coverage of the conflict has been widely critical of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression toward Ukraine, but there have been a few blunders as they fall into Russia’s false flag campaign of “will they or won’t they” invade. The constant flow of unverified and misleading information has made reporting the truth difficult for journalists. The Russian government especially has a track record of using social media to spread misinformation. There are language and cultural barriers as well, Lokot said, citing the example of when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cracked a joke about the date of the invasion and Western media reported it as fact. Russian coverage of the aggression Meanwhile, the Russian state media tactics are aimed at popularizing the idea that Ukraine should be under Russia’s control anyway, and that Russia’s current aggression is just a pretext to circulate this idea, Lokot said. Even though Ukraine isn’t part of NATO, U.S. funding and support have played a significant role in Ukraine’s current form of government, but this same fact is used by Putin to discredit Ukraine as a true democracy, she added. Messaging on the Russian side of things has also been mixed. In the past few weeks, “they've been gleeful at U.S. predictions (of an invasion) not coming true, but also saying that Russia can indeed invade any day and possibly should,” she said. Now that Russia has declared Donetsk and Luhansk “independent regions” and has moved into Donbas, we’re seeing Putin’s flirtation with invasion becoming reality. Russia has now launched attacks on Ukraine on multiple fronts in multiple cities, including Kyiv. The broad offensive has already killed dozens. Pause Before You Share As tensions boil over and headlines scream about the invasion, it’s easy to retweet or reshare updates without always verifying where they come from, particularly if it's news that aligns with your current perception of events. It’s also important to pay attention to the language used in articles and posts. A lot of Ukranians have been critical about some of the language used in headlines and articles from Englishspeaking news outlets. For example, calling Russia's attack on Ukraine a “civil war,” or using the Russian spelling or Ukraine’s capital (Kiev) instead of the Ukrainian spelling (Kyiv). Lokot advises readers to take a pause and consider where the information is coming from, and whether the information stated is conjecture or fact. Ask yourself the following questions: “Even if the media outlet is reputable, are they citing any sources? What are those sources? If they're saying that there's evidence, is there any actual evidence? Is there a video? Is there a photo? Is there a map?” Question the Source There have been quite a few selfproclaimed “experts” on Ukraine who have come out of the woodwork over the past several weeks. Before you take their word for it, it’s worth doing a bit more digging. “If I see a name that's unfamiliar to me, who is trying to be an authority on something, at the very least, I go and see who this person is and what their affiliation is,” Lokot said. Still Stumped? Here Are Some Sources to Follow: Follow credible sources to navigate the news of Russia's aggression in Ukraine Ukrainian voices are often missing in news stories about their own country.

OpenArchive is partnering with the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSMIraq), the first network of digital rights defenders and experts in Iraq, to bolster their archiving efforts and workflows. Established in 2011, INSMIraq is a nonprofit, nongovernmental civil society organization that advocates for a free, open, diverse, and safe internet. By cultivating networks between bloggers, journalists, activists, NGOs, and media organizations, INSMIraq pushes for an open internet free from restrictions set by governments or private corporations. OpenArchive’s partnership with INSMIraq will offer the Iraqi community new resources and tools to advance their mission. “We are so inspired by INSMIraq, who are doing incredibly important work to fight censorship, surveillance, targeting, and internet shutdowns to support civil society and internet freedom through human rights documentation and preservation work,” said Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Executive Director of OpenArchive. As Hayder Hamzoz, the Founder of INSMIraq noted, “...the Iraqi context is full of human rights violations, so eyewitness documentation is crucial for revealing the truth.” Digital and human rights threats and abuses are consistently observed and experienced in Iraq and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI). Website filtering and blocking, content censorship, internet shutdowns, and threats to witnesses are all violations that have impacted Iraq, which INSMIraq and OpenArchive seek to address with digital rights tools and training workshops. In recent years, civilians in Iraq and the KRI have faced notable rights violations as authorities have targeted mobile media – censoring and destroying evidence collected during protests and disproportionately arresting witnesses that collected evidentiary photos and video footage – and silenced dissenting voices in the media and in public forums. “Human rights defenders and eyewitness documentarians need support to promote their work and protect their identities. Partnering with OpenArchive will produce outcomes that will help INSMIraq better understand our communities' needs, risks, and priorities. This will then provide our communities with the necessary tools and trainings to advance their important work of documenting, verifying, and preserving evidence of human rights abuses to advance justice and accountability,\" said Hamzoz. OpenArchive’s partnership with INSMIraq represents a commitment to preserving and amplifying Iraqis’ voices and creating a secure archive of accessible and verified media. Through this partnership, we will conduct a needs assessments, create user personas, hold workshops to learn more about realworld archival practices to help inform our community, and adapt our archival tools to the local Iraqi context. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and easytouse mobile archiving tools and workflows. This methodology has been applied in recent research with OpenArchive’s partner, KHPG, in Ukraine and offers a critical foundation on which to further develop this research across regional contexts. Beyond this project with Iraq, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, human rights abuses, and violence from extremists. OpenArchive has active partnerships with DACs in Ukraine, MENA, Latin America, and other communities across the world. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding and by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive. It also conducts ethnographic research to learn about the DACs’needs and pain points, and trains them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows.

OpenArchive is partnering with the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) to support and enhance their impressive archival work. KHPG documents, preserves, and uses evidentiary media to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and bring justice to the Ukrainian people. This partnership bolsters KHPG’s work by supporting a decentralized archivist community of journalists, historians, lawyers, and other ontheground eyewitnesses to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. “Collaborating with KHPG to protect and preserve their crucial evidence is one of the most important and rewarding projects I’ve had the good fortune to work on,” said OpenArchive Founder & Executive Director Natalie Cadranel. “Their indestructible spirit, technological capabilities, and brilliant, dedicated team have shown incredible fortitude under extreme duress. Their commitment to exposing injustice and protecting human rights is truly inspirational.” Ukrainian authorities and international human rights groups are already investigating thousands of alleged war crimes since the start of Russia’s fullscale invasion in February 2022. These crimes include sexual violence, summary execution, looting, forced displacement, and countless other cases of abuse. Preserving evidence of these atrocities can aid in advancing the prosecution of these crimes and bringing closure to grieving families. “We must bring justice to the Ukrainian victims of Russian atrocities,” said KHPG Director Yevgeniy Zakharov. “It is crucial to document these horrific war crimes and ensure we preserve and verify this evidence effectively and securely. OpenArchive is playing a critical role to help us bolster this process. With their help, we are able to implement more streamlined ways to document war crimes with new technologies and create a more robust and secure archive. Our partnership is invaluable.” KHPG is one of the oldest and most active nongovernmental human rights organizations in Ukraine. The group documents human/civil rights abuses in Ukraine by recording interviews with victims and eyewitnesses of Russian war crimes and collecting evidence from open sources. KHPG also offers legal assistance to victims of the atrocities, bringing cases to the International Criminal Court and other international institutions. In March 2022, KHPG joined the Tribunal for Putin (T4P) global initiative alongside other human rights organizations to help collect opensource intelligence of Russian war crimes. 24 participating organizations specializing in specific regions verify and authenticate details from open sources while also gathering testimony from witnesses and victims. One of the members of the initiative, the Center for Civil Liberties, recently received the Nobel Peace prize 2022. “Behind each documented war crime, there is someone’s life that Russia ruined, traumatized, or claimed forever. Russia needs to be held accountable… We must help Ukrainians document Russia’s war crimes so that they will not repeat anywhere in the world,” said Viktoriia Savchuk, OpenArchive’s community manager for Ukraine. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. Beyond Ukraine, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, police brutality, and violence from farright extremists. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows. OpenArchive developed its Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2015 to circumvent these obstacles. Save helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses by routing their media to secure servers and public digital collections like the Internet Archive.

OpenArchive is partnering with two Latin American organizations, the Latin American Association for Alternative Development (ALDEA) in Ecuador and Cubalex, a Cuban NGO, to bolster community archiving efforts and workflows beyond our current projects in MENA and Ukraine. “After working primarily in North America, MENA, and Eastern Europe over the last decade, we are eager to finally address the needs for a secure way to verify and preserve evidentiary media that have been building in Latin America. Cubalex and ALDEA are doing important work to protect and defend human rights and we look forward to partnering with them to help them fulfill their critical missions,” said Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Executive Director of OpenArchive. “It is essential that those on the frontlines documenting evidence of abuse of power, social injustice, and human rights violations have access to the necessary tools and support to carry out their work more effectively and safely. OpenArchive’s partnerships with Cubalex and ALDEA are an excellent step towards holding those in power accountable, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, where authoritarianism is on the rise,” said David Aragort, OpenArchive’s Latin America DAC Manager. ALDEA Foundation is an Ecuadorian organization that aims to collectively design strategies with people, communities, and territories to advance development in human rights, gender equity, and interculturality. Since 2020, ALDEA has invested in building its organizational digital infrastructure to create more sustainable mechanisms for preserving documentation and multimedia content. OpenArchive’s partnerships with ALDEA will advance this project by helping integrate reliable workflow tools, develop compatible storage systems, and strengthen information management strategies. Cubalex is a Cuban NGO that defends and promotes human rights as a form of social transformation through legal aid and other resources. In recent years, the Cuban government has responded to dissent and public criticism with brutal repression and violence. Cubalex is one of the primary organizations documenting abuse against protesters and other human rights defenders. One of Cubalex’s top priorities is documentation and a significant volume of the organization’s resources are channeled towards safely maintaining evidence. OpenArchive’s partnership with Cubalex aims to expand the organization’s capacity to document and store evidence safely and securely. “The documentation and archiving of human rights violations have allowed Cubalex to raise awareness, sensitize the public, and reconstruct the historical memory in Cuba. The security and protection of information are part of the guarantees that victims need to exercise and enjoy their right to truth, justice, and reparation. We appreciate OpenArchive's opportunity to improve our archiving system and its contribution to ensuring that the horrors of the past and present in Cuba are not repeated in the future,” said Laritza Diversent, Executive Director of Cubalex. In the coming months, OpenArchive will be launching needs assessments with both the Ecuadorian and Cuban communities. The findings of these surveys will serve as the foundation for future coresearch, trainings, joint capacity building projects, and support within each region. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. OpenArchive mobilized this recent research alongside its partners – including KHPG in Ukraine, INSM in Iraq, and an organization in Sudan – which offers a critical foundation on which to further develop this research across regional contexts. Beyond these programs in Latin America, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, and human rights abuses. OpenArchive has active partnerships with DACs in Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, and the United States. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, trainings, and ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows.

La asociación de OpenArchive con Cubalex y ALDEA es un paso en la dirección correcta hacia la rendición de cuentas de quienes están en el poder, especialmente en América Latina y el Caribe, donde el autoritarismo siguen en aumento\", expresó David Aragort, Gerente del programa de Comunidad de Archivistas Descentralizados (CAD) de OpenArchive para América Latina. Fundación ALDEA es una organización ecuatoriana que tiene como objetivo diseñar estrategias colectivas con personas, comunidades y territorios para avanzar en el desarrollo de los derechos humanos, la equidad de género y la interculturalidad. Desde 2020, ALDEA ha invertido en la construcción de su infraestructura digital organizativa para crear mecanismos más sostenibles de preservación de documentación y contenidos multimedia. La asociación de OpenArchive con ALDEA impulsará este proyecto al ayudar a integrar herramientas de flujo de trabajo confiables, desarrollar sistemas de almacenamiento compatibles y fortalecer las estrategias de gestión de la información. Cubalex es una ONG cubana que defiende y promueve los derechos humanos como una forma de transformación social a través de la asistencia legal y otros recursos. En los últimos años, el gobierno cubano ha respondido a la disidencia y las críticas públicas con represión y violencia brutal. Cubalex es una de las principales organizaciones que documenta los abusos contra los manifestantes y otros defensores de derechos humanos. Una de las principales prioridades de Cubalex es la documentación, y un volumen significativo de los recursos de la organización se destina a mantener de manera segura la evidencia. La asociación de OpenArchive con Cubalex tiene como objetivo expandir la capacidad de la organización para documentar y almacenar evidencia de manera segura. “La documentación y archivo de violaciones de derechos humanos ha permitido a Cubalex visibilizar, sensibilizar y reconstruir la memoria histórica en Cuba. La seguridad y protección de la información es parte de las garantías que tienen las víctimas para ejercer y disfrutar su derecho a la verdad, la justicia y la reparación. Agradecemos a OpenArchive la oportunidad para mejorar nuestro sistema de archivo y su contribución para que los horrores del pasado y presente en Cuba no se repitan en el futuro” expresó Laritza Diversent, Directora Ejecutiva de Cubalex.

OpenArchive utiliza un enfoque de investigación y diseño centrado en los derechos humanos para trabajar con comunidades de todo el mundo y desarrollar herramientas y flujos de trabajo de archivo móvil más seguros y sencillos de usar. OpenArchive ha impulsado esta reciente investigación junto con sus socios, incluyendo KHPG en Ucrania, INSM en Irak y una organización en Sudán, lo que ofrece una base crítica para desarrollar aún más esta investigación en contextos regionales. Además de estos programas en Latinoamérica y el Caribe, OpenArchive continúa asociándose con Comunidades de Archivistas Descentralizados (CAD) en todo el mundo para preservar pruebas de crímenes de guerra, injusticia y abusos contra los derechos humanos. OpenArchive tiene asociaciones activas con CAD en Ucrania, Sudán, Irak y Estados Unidos. OpenArchive apoya a sus CAD con financiamiento, capacitación e investigación etnográfica para conocer sus necesidades y desafíos, compartiendo experiencia técnica sobre las mejores prácticas para crear y mantener un archivo seguro, y capacitándolos sobre cómo utilizar Save para proteger y simplificar sus flujos de trabajo de archivo. OpenArchive desarrolló su aplicación Save (por sus siglas en inglés: compartir, archivar, verificar, encriptar) en 2015 para superar estos obstáculos. Save ayuda a los testigos a preservar, proteger, autenticar y amplificar registros cruciales de abusos contra los derechos humanos.","news/archiving-forward-part-2":"title: Archiving Forward Part 2  Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystemdescription: How we build our organizational infrastructure for actiondate: 10/03/22category: Blogsimage: archivingforwardpart2.png Archiving Forward Part 2  Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystem How we build our organizational infrastructure for action “Power to the people” is as much an organizational strategy as it is a rallying cry. From the postcoup resistance in Myanmar, to antifascist movements in North America and Europe, the age of the internet and digital literacy among the masses drives home a more radical form of people power. We know that anyone with a smartphone can expose global injustice, but the irreplaceable moments we capture on our phones are fragile and ephemeral. Oftentimes, the only other versions of this evidentiary media reside on social media platforms that — while extremely effective in amplifying social causes and primary accounts of injustice — can chill free speech through content takedowns, government censorship, and privacy breaches. Social media also does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this irreplaceable media. That’s why archival activists like ourselves are embracing more decentralized organizational models and technologies to ensure redundancy and accessibility. This second part of our threepart “Archiving Forward” series will talk about our decentralized ecosystem, and how community organizations, tech developers, and everyday civilians each play a critical role in preserving, amplifying, and securely routing significant records of social movements, state violence, and human rights atrocities. The tech industry's exploitation of its “users'\" content, data, and privacy signals the need for an accessible public trust, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. Archiving Forward refers to a bottomup framework that brings autonomy back to the capturer. From the decentralized archivists who collect evidence of human rights atrocities to the collaborators and volunteers who build and contribute to our tools, to the stewards who amplify our work, we all have a hand in preserving truth to power. Decentralized Archivists We aren’t interested in creating a centralized archive at OpenArchive. Instead, we are cultivating decentralized, redundant, secure, robust, verifiable, and accessible archives that center the communities we work with. We use a human rights centered coresearch and design process to work with communities worldwide, which we refer to as Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs). These DACs are made up of citizen journalists, legal observers, historians, and civilian eyewitnesses who capture and store critical evidence of war crimes, farright militia activities, police violence, and other human rights abuses. This evidence is often stored on the most fragile devices they own – their phones. There are countless tools and resources for the creation and capture of digital media. We are in a moment where we need to demystify the preservation of this content. That’s why we are training communities in Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Latin America, and the U.S. on how to use our tools and safeguard their mobile media. For example in Ukraine, we already have folks on the ground documenting Russian war crimes and creating robust, verifiable, and accessible archives to bring accountability and justice. We are partnering with the [Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group KHPG) to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. In Philadelphia, PA, and Portland, OR, we are helping communities preserve evidence of social injustice, particularly violence from police and farright militias. OpenArchive and these DACs are implementing a robust, redundant, and interoperable archiving workflow. We are working with a number of communities that are already using our tools to create their own archives. Our goal is to engage more deeply with them by conducting collaborative research, educational outreach, and digital security trainings. Our Partners The role that individuals, small community organizations, and International NGOs play to create impactful archives cannot be overstated. We saw this in the Democratic Republic of Congo, when in 2018, two commanders of the rebel militia, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda received life sentences for murder and torture after video evidence was used to expose their crimes against humanity. Efforts to collect, archive, and verify this crucial evidentiary media were the result of a close collaboration between both individuals and NGOs like TRIAL International, WITNESS, and eyeWitness to Atrocities. The scope of our work cannot be achieved without missionaligned partner organizations that share our goals to achieve a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where the people's history is the primary history. Our collaboration with Guardian Project enabled us to launch our Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app. The partnership provided us with the technologists and usability expertise we needed to make Save an easytouse, secure archiving tool that empowers users to circumvent threats to free speech such as device confiscation, network blocking, doxxing, surveillance, and more. Secure, interoperable, and privacyminded tools are often inaccessible and unusable for small community organizations and everyday civilians. That’s where larger, wellresourced organizations or “stewards” come into play. Through our decentralized partnerships, we are leveraging our expertise and resources to demystify and adjust our tools and be more responsive to the communities they serve. Because Save is open source, others can adapt the app to fit their needs. Over the past decade, we’ve conducted coresearch with diverse communities worldwide to help us identify what critical features to add to our Save app. This research helped us to ensure the app is tailored to the communities who need it most. We intentionally developed Save as an open source application so that it can be modified by anyone to better adapt the features to their needs. Once we realized there was a need for Save within larger human rights NGOs, we partnered with Human Rights Watch to scope community needs, create personas, and adapt it for them, and ideally, other larger NGOs with similar needs. Save provides HRW with fully encrypted and selfhosted file transfer mapped to their archive for their international team. Partners like HRW act as our steward by using our tools and amplifying our guides and research with their communities, as well as sustaining the development of our work. Through collaboration, they help us adapt the tool and sustain our development work over time. Archival institutions like the Internet Archive provide free access to decades of digitized historical records. Our Save app utilizes the Internet Archive as an optional public backend in addition to connecting to private, secure, opensource servers so people have more control over who has access to their media collections. OpenArchive also unites the work of Creative Commons, Tor, and distributed secure servers like Nextcloud to offer atrisk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored. Volunteers and InKind Support Volunteers and organizations that provide inkind support are invaluable to the OpenArchive ecosystem. Global programs and educational institutions like Internews’ BASICS program , Outreachy, and the UC Berkeley School of Information provide us paid contractors who specialize in programming, research, user experience, documentation, graphic design, data science, marketing, and user advocacy. Localization Lab fills a critical role to help us translate and localize our research, guides and technology to make it more accessible for a global user base. Our volunteerrun advisory board is also instrumental in supporting our organization’s fundraising, communications and programmatic strategy.

Now we take time to demystify the preservation process for this content. Our “Archiving Forward” blog series will explore and explain how different actors, from individuals, to community organizations, to technology providers, each play critical roles in preserving, amplifying, and securely sending significant and impactful mobile media to their destinations. Archiving Forward refers to a framework for bringing autonomy back to the capturer, through usercreated collections in an accessible public trust or private server, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. When we began researching and prototyping our mobile application for ethical preservation (what is now Save) back in 2013, we discovered four key challenges facing organizations interested in managing mobile media: Few initiatives to collective mobile media; No easy way to preserve or license mobile media; Pressing privacy considerations; and A lack of resources. Looking back, it is astonishing how quickly technological innovation has been able to mitigate these key challenges. In particular, the advent of the cloud, and adjacent open source technologies and documentation, make the task of preservation much more affordable and accessible than it used to be. For the first entry in our Archiving Forward series, we will demystify the “cloud”: what it is, the benefits and drawbacks of using it to share and store media, and how we are utilizing it within the human rights community. We will also discuss why we chose Nextcloud as our preferred cloud backend. What is the cloud? A cloud is a type of server, so in order to understand the cloud, it ishelpful to be familiar with the term “server.” A server is a computer,or a computer program, that manages access to a centralized resource orservice in a network. A server’s function is to store, retrieve and sendcomputer files and data to other computers on a network  so the morecomputers and files you have that are regularly accessing a central body, themore important it becomes to ensure that these interactions are secure andeasily accessible. The following infographic via NSA's cloud security basics illustrates the various forms that the cloud can take: What are the main benefits of storing media in the cloud for the Human Rights Community? At OpenArchive our mission is to prioritize usability and privacy in our tools. Cloudbased storage considerably minimizes the cost of securely storing and sharing digital content, without requiring highly technical expertise and training. This way, public interest organizations, as well as individuals, can easily run, manage, and maintain a server. Additional benefits include: Improved privacy & security: some cloud services offer multiple layers of encryption and allow managers to set user controls, enabling them to choose who has access to the media on the cloud, as well as their level of access; More affordable than a local server: the cloud is relatively inexpensive over time; Easier to use: the UI (user interface) doesn’t require any coding knowledge and there is ample technical support available; and More accessible: all organizations need in order to access and manage the cloud is an internet connection. However, not all cloud services are equal when it comes to security and privacy, there are key privacy risks involved when using the cloud. While the cloud has benefits for organizations with less sensitive media, those housing media that can put people at risk of prosecution or violence if leaked, should consider only having offline, redundant servers. What are the key risks when using the cloud? The two primary risks people face when using the cloud are malicious adversary activity (i.e. hacking/data breaches) and unintentional configuration flaws. To reiterate, we strongly recommend those with highly sensitive media (i.e. whistleblowers, media organizations, legal advocates, etc.) use local, offline, physical servers. Data breaches: Large companies are more likely to be targeted by hackers; and Configuration flaws: Large companies with big servers handling multiple tasks are more susceptible to coding errors and other issues that are out of the control of the individuals or organizations that rely on them. Now that we’ve highlighted some benefits and risks of using the cloud, we recommend taking the following features into consideration when choosing a remote cloud storage solution. Why did we choose Nextcloud as a preferred private backend for Save? We chose to include Nextcloud as one of Save's backends because they offer selfhosting, prioritize encryption, are committed to usability, and have a consistent privacy policy. It is easy to use both remotely and locally, and is the most secure option, especially if people maintain their local own servers. Additionally, Nextcloud offers three layers of encryption on their servers making it less vulnerable to hackers than other cloud services. These are cornerstones of the Save project, which ensures media files are accessed, stored and shared securely. Do any other cloud backends work with Save Save not only integrates with open source cloud services like Nextcloud, but also features the ability to save media to both the Internet Archive and Dropbox backends, as well. By offering 3 different types of backends to use with Save, our goal is to support people’s varying storage needs. We will be including more as new options for secure, distributed storage emerge. In addition to Nextcloud, an open source cloud and physical server private backend, Save is also compatible with DropBox because it is more widelyused and accessible as many already have accounts (but offers less security), and the Internet Archive, a public backend committed to interoperability that guarantees your media is accessible online and in the future as formats evolve. While the cloud is no silver bullet, we believe Nextcloud is the best option for human rights defenders managing collections of sensitive mobile media who lack the capacity to host and maintain their own servers.","news/congress-privacy-bill":"title: What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy billdescription: A federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections.date: 09/08/22category: Blogsimage: usprivacybill.jpeg What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy bill A federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections. The U.S. Legislature is the closest it has ever been to passing a federal data privacy law with the recent draft of the bipartisan American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA). Americans are long overdue for a federal privacy law. While the ADPPA does contain some good policies – particularly for states that don’t already have strong online privacy regulation – the bill in its current form could weaken or even strip away existing privacy protections in states like California which have robust privacy laws. Here’s what you need to know: Who does the ADPPA regulate? The ADPPA broadly applies to organizations and companies operating in the United States, including corporations and nonprofits. The draft bill defines “covered entities'' as anyone who “collects, processes, or transfers covered data and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act.” This means big tech giants, like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, that mine sensitive information from millions of Americans would theoretically see unprecedented federal regulations. First, the good parts about the bill: It requires data collection to be as minimal as possible. It allows individuals to optout of “transfers of covered data,” limiting some forms of targeted marketing. It gives users the right to correct inaccuracies and potentially delete personal data collected by “covered entities.” It prevents some companies from using contract law to skirt the bill’s regulations. But the bill falls short on what is needed for robust privacy protections: It has a broad preemption provision, which means it would override, and in some cases, roll back, existing state and federal privacy protections, including California’s Consumer Privacy Protection Act. It doesn’t provide enough protections for individuals who want to sue companies that violate their privacy rights. It has loopholes that would treat some companies as “service providers,” giving them more leeway for collecting data. It still broadly allows targeted advertising, which is a major driver of most commercial surveillance. You can read more about the bill’s restrictions in EFF’s July 24, 2022 blog post about the bill. What people/organizations in our space are saying about the ADPPA “Federal privacy laws should not roll back state privacy protections. The ADPPA, as currently written, would override a broad swath of existing state laws and prevent states from future action on those areas, a structure called \"preemption.\" We have expressed disappointment and called on Congress to do better.”–Hayley Tsukayama, senior legislative activist at EFF “It seems like a good faith effort, but the details will be key. Basically every privacy expert and advocacy group is reading it right now.”–Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future “A lot’s being said about the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. But not nearly enough on how it dismantles current privacy laws, including over 50 years of work in California. There’s a reason Big Tech supports it. And it’s not because they care about our rights.”–ACLU of Northern California What’s next for the ADPPA? Now that Congress is back from recess, the future of the ADPPA looks uncertain. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) announced on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2022 that she is concerned about the bill’s preemption provisions, saying it \"does not guarantee the same essential consumer protections as California’s existing privacy laws.\" Whether the bill has any hope of moving forward or is simply dead in the water depends on whether some sort of agreement will be reached that – at the very least – softens the preemption provision. You can read more about the political roadblocks ahead here in the International Association of Privacy Professionals' Sept. 6, 2022 Privacy Advisor post. What you can do The ADPPA still hasn’t reached the House floor so there is time to contact your representative and tell them that the bill doesn’t go far enough in protecting your online privacy. We deserve legislation that encourages more robust online privacy protections, not laws that weaken the protections that already exist.","news/digital-impact-podcast":"title: Digital Impact Interview with Nataliedescription: Founder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eyewitnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorredate: 08/20/20category: Newsimage: digitalimpactinterviewwithNatalie.png Digital Impact Interview with Natalie Founder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eyewitnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorre Save, a New OpenSource App, Empowers Citizen Reporters Hear Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive, in conversation with Chris Delatorre from Stanford's Digital Impact Hub about the why, what, where, who, and how of \"Save\".

Through this collaboration, we are receiving a grant from FFDW to expand our global partnerships with human rights defenders and join the growing movement to create and utilize a more ethical, decentralized internet. OpenArchive will now be able to support those who collect evidentiary media by expanding the capacity of our Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app to include decentralized backends. This will enable people on the ground capturing images and footage of crucial world events to leverage IPFS, Filecoin, and other decentralized storage options from their phones. Citizens armed with phones are history’s first responders, accelerating the push for worldwide social justice, using their smartphones as a tool to capture human rights violations around the world. However, many of these recordings are currently stored on vulnerable platforms that do not provide sufficient privacy protections or preservation of this vital media. When data is in the hands of a single company, it is susceptible to censorship, manipulation, or systemwide failure – putting the records of human history at risk. Decentralized technology offers a better alternative: it allows atrisk communities to own and control records to ensure transparency, accountability, and durability. Every day, witnesses and citizen reporters bravely capture breaking world events–and all too often human rights violations–on their phones. At OpenArchive, we work to enable them to securely share, verify, and preserve this crucial media to ultimately bring accountability and justice. We’re thrilled to work with FFDW to build the web we want by implementing and deploying decentralized technology to empower witnesses to protect and preserve truth to power. Natalie CadranelFounder and Executive Director of OpenArchive Save is a secure archiving app that helps people share, archive, verify, and and encrypt their mobile media. They can do so by securely uploading it, keeping it safe and organized for the longterm, and capturing crucial metadata to further authenticate it. With support from FFDW, we are enhancing our existing archival tools to support decentralized storage solutions through Save. This work will ensure that everyone will have longterm access to secure and resilient decentralized storage to protect and preserve humanity’s most important information. Additionally, as part of the grant, we will embark on a campaign to educate people and organizations around the world about the benefits of adopting decentralized storage protocols by equipping them with tools and educational resources. Our work will also focus on empowering atrisk communities to move away from the singlepointoffailure infrastructure that they rely on today. Our mission is to permanently preserve humanity’s most important information. We are proud to support OpenArchive’s work to preserve critical human rights data using the decentralized web.Marta BelcherBoard chair of the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web Learn more about FFDW grant programs here!","news/global-encryption-day-23":"title: \"Preserving the Past, Protecting the Future: The Vital Role of Encryption in Media Preservation\"description: Human rights archivists rely on encryption to protect atrisk communities, safeguard sensitive media, maintain data integrity, control access, and facilitate secure storage and transfer.date: 10/20/23category: Blogsimage: GlobalEncryptionDay23/1.png Preserving the Past, Protecting the Future: The Vital Role of Encryption in Media Preservation Human rights archivists rely on encryption to protect atrisk communities, safeguard sensitive media, maintain data integrity, control access, and facilitate secure storage and transfer In today's digital age, smartphones are a powerful tool for capturing and preserving daily life events. They are especially valuable for journalists, activists, or eyewitnesses seeking to bring justice and awareness to the human rights violations they are documenting. While this media is incredibly valuable, it is just as fragile. Both the media and those capturing it are subject to targeting, surveillance, data breaches, theft, or accidental loss. Encryption mitigates many of these safety and privacy threats, thus allowing for the access and longterm preservation of this critical media without interference. So what is encryption exactly? “Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process of converting humanreadable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext.” For more information about what encryption is and why it’s important, check out this article by the EFF. “What Should I Know About Encryption?” At OpenArchive, we collaborate with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide who rely on encryption to protect themselves and their sensitive communications. We equip them with responsive tools like the Save app to enhance their privacy and improve their preservation efforts. This app enables users to share, archive, verify, and, aptly, encrypt their media intransit. To commemorate Global Encryption Day, here are three key ways encryption protects our decentralized archivist communities and their media: 1. Protecting Media: KHPG, our DAC partner in Ukraine, reports that they previously received evidence from multiple unencrypted sources. When using Save, their media is protected intransit by Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS encrypts data transmitted over the Internet and protects media as it is sent from phone to server. Additionally, Save uses the Tor network via Orbot, free open source software that protects media intransit by using Tor to help mitigate network surveillance and other threats to your privacy. It does so by encrypting your IP address and browsing history, and routing your internet traffic through randomlychosen relay servers. 2. Managing Access: In recent years, authorities in Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI) have increasingly targeted mobile media – censoring and destroying evidence collected during protests and disproportionately arresting witnesses that collected evidentiary photos and video footage. Encryption functions as a digital lock, allowing users to control who can access and decrypt their media. This prevents bad actors from accessing media even if they are able to intercept the communications. With Save, in addition to intransit media encryption, users can choose to send media to a server with multiple layers of encryption such as Nextcloud or Owncloud servers. 3. Preserving Evidence: In Ecuador, human rights defenders documenting violations of Indigenous people’s rights face a myriad of physical and digital threats that put them and their evidentiary media at risk. Encryption helps to secure media archives, which protects them from badactors over the long term. Save benefits your media archives by offering additional protection against unauthorized access and the ability to easily store multiple copies of your media on different secure servers. At OpenArchive, we prioritize encryption in our tool Save because it helps protect sensitive media and its sources, manage data access, and protects evidence for long term preservation. Whether in Ukraine, Iraq, Ecuador, or anywhere injustice persists, encryption is crucial for preserving truth to power.

The web we want Social media and other usergenerated content platforms  sometimes referred to as “web 2.0”  promised to empower individuals from around the world by providing new communication channels to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. Despite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical. Contra Media Ecosystems of Control Social media and other usergenerated content platforms  sometimes referred to as “web 2.0”  promised to empower individuals from around the world by providing new communication channels to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. The ability for internet users to instantly upload content gave rise to an unprecedented look into political rallies, natural disasters, and military conflicts, but also daily life unfolding around the globe. People flocked to such platforms, so much so that, today, hundreds of hours of video content is added to social media platforms like YouTube each minute, while streaming services like Facebook Live have racked up over 2 billion viewers. Despite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical. Over the past decade, this power has become centralized and entrenched. Motivated by profit maximization and an everexpanding quest for new markets, these corporate giants have made Faustian deals with governments around the world to keep their services streaming into some of the world’s most repressive regimes. As such, these great content repositories of the modern area have become tools of control rather than the onceheralded \"platforms of the people\". Digital artifacts uploaded to the major social platforms are regulated by both a country’s laws and companies’ own internal content guidelines; and while the amount of mobile media traversing these global platforms is stunning, little attention is paid to their respect for human rights or longevity of access to uploaded content. Delicate Memories Despite their popularity, the world can not count on global technology companies to have their users' backs. Activists and technologists must forge their own paths by building new technologies and leveraging grassroots communities. OpenArchive was born out of the need for a mobile tool that offers secure, longterm storage of photos, video, and audio captured on mobile devices. Our tool seeks to solve the issues related to keeping people and their media safe, sustaining legacy access to, and providing verifiable authenticity of content. In highrisk situations, this need becomes even more profound. Human rights defenders, citizen journalists, and frontline activists are being targeted on social media and do not have safe, alternative ways to manage and store their sensitive mobile media. In some cases, being digitally compromised can impact an individual’s freedom and wellbeing. Whose Media? Our Media! Before users learn the hard way that they cannot trust YouTube, Facebook, iCloud, Google Photos and other corporate platforms with valued and sensitive digital media, we provide an alternative secure archiving solution at scale. To further this goal, OpenArchive works with Guardian Project, who specialize in creating secure, open source technologies. Through this partnership, along with security usability experts, we will double our efforts to provide our global community with an easytouse, secure archiving application that empowers users to circumvent threats to freedom of expression such as device confiscation, network blocking, internet shutdowns, and more. OpenArchive is working towards secure, ethical, and usable solutions for you and your communities. We’re listening! In order to make the strongest product for our users, we want to hear from you. If you have recommendations on how we can improve the OpenArchive experience, take a moment to email us at: info[at]openarchive.org If you would like to become involved with technical testing, let us know.","news/human-rights-day":"title: \"A Year in Review: Celebrating the impact of our Decentralized Archivist Communities\"description: This Human Rights Day, OpenArchive is highlighting the important work our Decentralized Archivist Communities do to fight for a more just world for atrisk groups. They work to combat electoral violence, threats to the environment, genderbased violence, arbitrary detention, and many other pressing issues.date: 12/11/23category: Blogsimage: HumanRightsDay/1.png A Year in Review: Celebrating the impact of our Decentralized Archivist Communities This Human Rights Day, OpenArchive is highlighting the important work our Decentralized Archivist Communities do to fight for a more just world for atrisk groups. They work to combat electoral violence, threats to the environment, genderbased violence, arbitrary detention, and many other pressing issues. OpenArchive is fortunate to collaborate with inspiring Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) who are actively defending human rights across the world. In 2023, our six DACs from Eastern Europe, MENA, and Latin America, continued their work to document violations and safeguard evidence despite escalating challenges and human rights abuses. This Human Rights Day, we reflect on their work and the coresearch conducted with them this year. Fighting for Justice in the Face of Repression, Oppression, Violence, and War Crimes Government Violations in Mexico Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists and human rights defenders to operate in. One of our key DAC partners, Data Cívica, has had a remarkable year using data and technology to strengthen journalism and civil society in Mexico while fighting electoral violence, genderbased violence, and assisting in the search for missing people and clandestine graves and increasing transparency and accountability in the country. In partnership with Data Cívica, we have focused our efforts on addressing significant challenges faced by those working to document human rights violations in the country, which include both physical and digital threats. It is important for those working to document and preserve evidentiary media that their media is safe from spyware, hacking, and device confiscation. They also need a secure and reliable internet connection and messaging apps, and a private, secure, yet usable way of storing and analyzing their media. Working with Data Cívica in the Mexican context is an opportunity for OpenArchive to provide support for training, skill development, and integrating secure archiving tools to better protect them and their media as they carry out their important work. Repression of Dissidents in Cuba The Cuban government has responded to public criticism with brutal repression and violence in recent years. Dissidents face many threats, such as restrictions on freedom of expression and access to information, which include the blocking of websites and social media sites, travel bans, and physical danger and threats. Our partner Cubalex conducts monthly monitoring of the state of human rights in Cuba and documents human rights abuses like arbitrary detention and unfair prison sentences, forced exile from Cuba, and harsh and unjust responses to dissent. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Cuban counterparts by facilitating training on best archival practices, technical skills, digital security, and expanding organizational capacity through the Save app. Indigenous People’s Rights Violations in Ecuador Human rights defenders in Ecuador face increasing rates of political violence and attacks. Our Ecuadorian DAC, the Latin American Association for Alternative Development (ALDEA), aims to collectively design strategies with people, communities, and territories to advance development in human rights, gender equity, and interculturality. Their projects include supporting Indigenous land rights against extraction corporations, advocating for the inclusion of forest people in global negotiations on forests and climate change, and mapping femicide and monitoring genderbased violence amongst others. We are thrilled to be supporting these human rights defenders as they document and advocate for change amidst clashes with mining operators and government officials. The Escalating Conflict in Sudan Sudan's escalating conflict poses extreme challenges for human rights defenders, many of whom have been displaced from the country. Our Sudanese partner, who wishes to remain anonymous, showed incredible resilience this year as they progress their work despite displacement and violence. They continue to promote justice and accountability and promote access to trusted information. When it comes to archiving, our coresearch with this organization identified primary resource gaps as insecure archival practices, technologies and software that don’t prioritize privacy, and a lack of security training and resources. Through Save app trainings and continued collaboration, we are working to address some of these gaps and provide the necessary tools to protect them and their media. Free Speech Threats in Iraq In Iraq, human rights defenders face a severe threat to free speech due to proposed digital content regulations that could criminalize investigative journalism and undermine freedom of speech. This threat adds to the existing challenges of internet shutdowns, censorship, and targeting of activists. This year, the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSM) reported on the Iraqi government's attempts to repress free expression through an online platform for flagging “indecent” social media content and the reintroduction of draft laws that would curb freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Iraq. As part of the MENA Alliance for Digital Rights and a collective of human rights and civil society organizations, INSM was, and continues to be, vocal about respect for the digital rights of Palestinians and the need to restore telecoms and internet connectivity in Gaza. Research OpenArchive conducted with the (INSM) revealed gaps in technical resources, training, outdated devices, and legal protections for documenters. Through a series of community workshops, INSM and OpenArchive have started deploying Save and providing training and support to those working to document and preserve evidence of human rights violations in Iraq. War Crimes in Ukraine The realities of working as a human rights documenter in an active war zone are complex and often unique to specific regions and contexts. As we near the twoyear anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, we remain amazed by our partner Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group’s (KHPG) strength. Their “Voices of War” project centers eyewitness accounts and reflections on the war. With headlines such as “We were nothing and nobody. We were a human shield for the Russians” and “Nothing left. Everything was burnt out”, these profiles highlight the human side and toll of the violence. Through our work, in collaboration with the KHPG, we identified the significant challenges documenters and archivists face in Ukraine, which included complex and imperfect database systems and incomplete information regarding attacks and hostilities. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our KHPG counterparts and facilitating trainings on best archiving and digital security practices in active war zones to help fill some of the existing gaps identified by those on the ground. Reflecting on 2023 and Archiving Forward Through several phases of coresearch, OpenArchive learned more about the unique contexts our DACs work in and gained a better understanding of their needs. Using these findings, we customized workshops and trainings and implemented usability enhancements to our Save app to better protect them and their media as they work to document, preserve, and share evidence of human rights abuses. We look forward to continuing this work and expanding our DAC program next year. As we commemorate Human Rights Day and reflect on our partners’ work throughout this year, our commitment to activists and eyewitnesses remains firm. By equipping them with tools to navigate the challenges of the digital era, we are doing our small part in advancing justice and accountability around the world.","news/introducing-save":"title: Introducing Savedescription: The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of Save, our new mobile application that integrates privacyenhancing technologies with digital media preservation to make media findable, verifiable, and archived for longterm access.date: 05/13/18category: Newsimage: IntroducingSave.png Introducing Save The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of Save, our new mobile application that integrates privacyenhancing technologies with digital media preservation to make media findable, verifiable, and archived for longterm access. The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of Save, our new mobile application that integrates privacyenhancing technologies with digital media preservation to make media findable, verifiable, and archived for longterm access. Save enables individuals and organizations to streamline their management process for managing mobile media documentation, enhance their digital content collaboration, and make it easier to securely archive community and sensitive media. From social networks to video hostingplatforms, many of the goto media hosting platforms are monetized by invasive adtech, driven by surveillance features, and subjected to arbitrary content takedowns. We created Save to authenticate and safeguard media for longterm preservation and protect the identity of thosesharing their documentation. While researching and creating the tool with the communities it serves, we paid special attention to threats that we increasingly encounter when posting citizen journalism online, such as internet shutdowns, targeting journalists online, device confiscations,censorship, limited bandwidth, and data loss. While embarking on OpenArchive’s journey to launch our new flagship tool Save, we were deliberately careful to incorporate feedback from our extensive ethnographic research and incorporate emergent digital archiving practices. With a mission to provide an alternative hostingframework to commercially available products, Save puts control of the lifecycle of mobilemedia back in the hands of those who created the media: citizen journalists, human rights defenders, and others risking their freedom to share their stories. With native functionalities that include adding nuanced metadata for verification and Creative Commons licensing, Savewas built to streamline a user experience that is intuitive for both individuals and organizations. We couldn’t be where we are today without a wonderful community of supporters, many of whom have volunteered their time to help us design Save with our endusers’ safety, security and diverse circumstances in mind. We are also grateful to generous support from the Open Technology Fund and Knight Foundation who have helped OpenArchive continue to develop tools, integrate best practices, and improve usability over the past years. In the coming year, the OpenArchive team will continue to engage with our community, offer trainings, improve documentation, share our expertise, and advocate for open archiving frameworks that allow people to store and manage their content outside the walled gardens of proprietary Silicon Valley companies. Last month, OpenArchive’s founder Natalie joined panels and hosted a workshopto share Save with the Human Rights community at RightsCon in Tunis. We want to take every opportunity we have to engage with the communities we serve so we can continually improve the functionality and usability they require and ensure that people canmanage their digital media outside of the surveillance capitalismdriven media management systems currently on the market.

At OpenArchive, we center human rights and our communities throughout our research and development processes to best protect those who are often risking their lives to capture, preserve, authenticate, and share evidence of injustice. We know that with the right tools, they have the potential to proliferate justice and accountability by exposing abuses spanning from police brutality, protests, and government corruption to war crimes, environmental harm and many other human rights offenses. While decentralized storage and the blockchain are highly effective technologies that can improve the archival workflow by offering media redundancy, improved accessibility, authentication, and provenance for that media, we have reservations about their disadvantages for our Decentralized Archivist Communities. At best, we hope that they will be able to provide secure, distributed, verifiable, longterm archival storage for their crucial evidentiary media. Toward this end, we will explore their benefits, risks, and drawbacks in forthcoming publications. We will now focus on mapping out the functionalities of these technologies, their potential, their limitations, and some key projects in the field. Decentralized Storage 101 At the core of the archival process lies the critical component of storage. In the spirit of the organization and archival ethos “Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe” (LOCKSS), decentralized storage can solve the redundancy challenge archives face. Decentralized storage technologies involve distributing data across multiple computers and regions, each independently controlled by a different entity. In this way, they can offer a more robust and collaborative approach to data hosting, longterm preservation, and access. The concept of distributing data across multiple computers is not, in itself, particularly novel. In fact, distributing data is a broadly applied technology that enables large providers to coordinate the immense storage and computing resources needed to operate many popular online services. Consider, for instance, the massive volumes of data that large social media platforms handle—petabytes of information distributed across datacenters spanning multiple geographic locations. Distributed storage is a useful technology for large digital archives. The Internet Archive stores, as of January 2024, over 99 petabytes of data in various remote facilities that they administer themselves. In particular, they host multiple copies of the files simultaneously, each stored in a different location, to assure the availability of the service and the resilience of the information stored, as technical failures in one of the data centers will not bring down or destroy the archive. In an effort to ensure the longevity of the archive, they are joining forces with the Filecoin decentralized ecosystem as well as with international entities across the globe that also replicate a copy on their data centers. Brewster Kahle, Founder of the Internet Archive, explains “decentralized storage is absolutely critical, and having no points of absolute control is the only way to make things last a long time”. What truly defines a storage system as decentralized, beyond data distribution, is the underlying principle that the computers hosting the data are controlled by different entities and that no single entity exercises full control. This kind of “true” decentralization as a way to mitigate risk and liability, serves as a safeguard against undue influence or tampering by protecting the archive from interference, such as censorship or media manipulation, and technical failures –an important consideration when dealing with sensitive evidentiary media. Distributing responsibilities across multiple entities can improve redundancy and split up the tasks of managing, curating and hosting the archive. The cryptographic foundations of any welldesigned decentralized system have the added benefit of providing privacy and thus reducing the potential for individual entities to be held solely accountable. To navigate the diverse ecosystem of decentralized storage systems, we classify them into three categories based on who is storing the files: userhosted systems, in which all users actively participate in file storage; delegated systems, where the responsibility of providing storage resources is delegated to a select group of computers; and blockchainbased systems, wherein storage providers are compensated with cryptocurrency tokens. All three categories are decentralized, as they are based on distributed systems with open specifications and, in most cases, they allow anyone to join the network. (The classification based on who is hosting the files is important because it determines technical requirements from users as well as the security and availability of the system.) UserHosted Decentralized Storage Networks The use of decentralized storage for archival purposes has its origins dating back to 1996, with the inception of the Eternity Service, followed by Publius, the Free Haven project, Tangler, and Freenet among others. These projects shared a common approach: all users participate in the replication of data  creating a resilient, redundant, distributed data storage system that makes it difficult to take down content and ensures longterm accessibility. As long as even one of the computers hosting a file remains accessible, then that file remains available within the system. Consequently, it becomes exceedingly challenging for an oppressive agent to take down all computers hosting a specific file, particularly when these computers are located outside that agent’s control. Users can retrieve files from any of the computers with a copy, without having to rely on a central archive. The archive remains live even when a subset of the hosting computers goes offline. This first category of decentralized storage systems highlights two building blocks, helpful for human rights archiving: cryptography and peertopeer networking. Let us look at these two features in more detail, focusing first on cryptography. Cryptography ensures data integrity and user privacy. Cryptographic hashes and digital signatures help verify that the data has not been modified or corrupted, even when stored or transferred over untrusted computers. Anonymity and plausible deniability, achieved by cryptographic techniques and by mixing together the activity of multiple users, allow users to host and access the archive without fear, as their requests cannot be linked to their identity, and they cannot be held accountable for content they store and transfer. Here is an illustration of how these networks work: Diagram 1: In userhosted decentralized storage networks all users participate in hosting and transferring encrypted parts of the files. In order to preserve the privacy of requests, rather than connecting directly with the target computer, users route their traffic through intermediary computers. In principle, given that everyone is relaying requests on behalf of others, it would be difficult to prove that a specific user is providing or accessing a specific piece of data, rather than merely acting as an intermediary relay. Each computer in the network creates a constant endtoend encrypted traffic pattern by also relaying the requests of others, making it difficult for adversaries who observe network activity to figure out when a user is active or idle. Therefore, the traffic from any given computer is the same whether the user is interacting with files or just sitting idle. This endtoend encryption allows for “plausible deniability” whereby the operator of any computer in the network cannot know what data they are relaying or storing, and can thus deny any responsibility for it. Here's how plausible deniability works in detail: During the publication process, a file is divided into fixedsized encrypted fragments before being uploaded; These fragments are then duplicated across multiple computers located in different parts of the network; a. Crucially, the computers responsible for storing and transmitting these encrypted fragments do not possess the decryption key and can, therefore, plausibly deny knowledge of their content. Still, users who know the decryption key can retrieve these fragments from the decentralized storage network and reassemble them into the original file. Let us now look at the second feature of userhosted decentralized storage systems that is uniquely suited for human rights archiving: peertopeer networking. In peertopeer networks like Freenet everyone can openly participate by contributing storage resources from their computer. The diversity of participants enhances the security and availability of the system, rendering it more robust and resilient for archiving purposes, as it is more difficult for divergent/independent entities to simultaneously get coerced, have a computer failure, or delete their copy of the archive. However, allowing everyone to participate can also introduce certain challenges and vulnerabilities. For instance, the dynamic nature of participants, with individuals joining and leaving the network, can make it more difficult to stabilize the system, and can make files or parts of files go offline, resulting in increased complexity and degradation of performance and reliability as the network must make new links and continually update routing decisions. Moreover, open participation means that malicious entities can also enter the network. In practice, these malicious actors can observe traffic in the network and strategically position themselves to deanonymize targeted users, or even overload the network with dubious content and traffic, thereby compromising the system’s functionality and privacy properties. Another issue is that individual users may not want to store unknown data from other participants. Fears of legal attack from storing shards of, for instance, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), or ethical concerns about assisting political opponents or aggressors may dissuade users from participating – whether anyone else can technically prove their involvement or not. Recognizing these challenges, researchers and developers of decentralized storage systems have been exploring ways to address them. One direction involves isolating the network of legitimate users from spammers and malicious entities by leveraging social trust and reputation mechanisms. This can be achieved by establishing connections only with known contacts, such as in friendofafriend networks like Tribler and XVine, and prioritizing content endorsed by users within their extended social circles, as seen in the Freenet Web of Trust. Furthermore, beyond the security benefits, these socialbased strategies also give a significant boost to how well the system performs. Imagine social groups as closeknit circles of users who talk often, live nearby, and share similar interests. These circles minimize the need for involving computers from outside the group, instead emphasizing localfirst connections which in turn grant faster data access, increased reliability, and better assurances that relevant content is readily available to the users within the group. While there are many upsides to this feature, we must also consider that this approach reveals the users' social graphs and can also slow down requests outside the social group. Delegated Decentralized Storage Networks An alternative to userhosted systems is one that divides hosting into more distinct nodes: those who are using a network for downloading data and those who make that data available. Here, the responsibility of providing storage is delegated to a select group of computers, resulting in a more userfriendly experience, somewhat similar to cloud computing models. The utilization of decentralized storage technologies offers the flexibility to establish a scalable, selforganizing storage network and enables availability and privacy properties that are not possible with centralized cloud providers. Prominent examples of delegated networks are IPFS and Hypercore, which provide a suite of decentralized protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring data that can be adapted to work for both users who store data and those who simply access it. With regards to what content gets stored in the network, both IPFS and Hypercore leave that to the discretion of the storage providers who choose which files they will replicate locally. Files hosted on these networks can be retrieved from any of the computers storing them. On the user side, accessing content is possible either by running their own local nodes or via HTTP requests to Web gateways operated by others, making them accessible and userfriendly for a wide range of applications. A core concern of hosting an archive on these \"collectivized\" decentralized storage networks is who is providing the infrastructure, meaning who are the entities that comprise the group of computers that store users' data. These concerns are more pronounced because of the smaller set of infrastructure providers. Who can join the group? What are their powers over the archive? What are the incentives that push them to contribute resources for other users? The answers to these questions ultimately determine important properties of the archive's resilience, privacy, and usability. The default participation model of IPFS and Hypercore allows everyone to join the network and replicate the content they want. In other words, an open model similar to the userhosted systems described above. Participating peers, in this case, are in the privileged position to observe who is reading or writing content in the decentralized storage. For this reason, delegated decentralized storage networks can also operate as an inviteonly collaborative cluster. For example, Āhau is a collective archive curated and hosted by Māori tribes to “capture, preserve and share cultural heritage, histories and narratives”. Tribal records are replicated among the personal devices of a few volunteer members, while others can access and curate them using their Web browser. Since human rights archives are often created and maintained by atrisk, targeted groups, privacy and security are nonnegotiable features. Given this, let’s consider how cryptographic techniques can be added to delegated decentralized storage networks to increase security. This can involve improvements to the networks’ own design (for instance, IPFS’s recent work on reader privacy), or by integrating anonymising protocols like Tor. To offer users content confidentiality, access control, and availability properties, someone developing this backend for a human rights archive might seek to apply objectcapability models to ensure that only authorized entities can access the data. These models can be applied either on routing protocols (as in OCapN and Ceramic's CACAO), or on the data structures that encapsulate content, as in Secure Scuttlebutt's private messages. Moreover, delegated decentralized storage networks can employ threshold cryptography, breaking files into encrypted overlapping parts, so that they can be reconstructed into the original file even when a threshold of them gets lost. We find examples of this in TahoeLAFS and Storj, which build on threshold cryptography to improve resilience and strengthen availability, anticipating cases where a proportion of hosting providers get compromised or delete user files. Let us now, finally, turn to the blockchain. BlockchainBased Decentralized Storage Networks Most of the decentralized storage systems discussed so far rely largely on volunteers to ensure continuity of the archive. What the blockchain does, however, is ensure continuity of the archive by coupling it with an economic system – one that aims to bypass the power controls of governmentissued currencies. The IPFS and Hypercore delegated decentralized storage networks we mentioned in the previous section, for instance, serve as the base of blockchainincentivized storage networks Filecoin and DatDot, respectively. More specifically, Filecoin’s decentralized storage operates in the following way: IPFS is the peer to peer data syncing & DHT management protocol, and Filecoin is an implementation of IPFS that layers on a cryptocurrencybased incentive system used to pay for storage, among other things. Other popular projects in the same vein include Swarm, Arweave and Codex. Blockchains, initially introduced with Bitcoin, incorporate cryptographic, governance, and monetary policy protocols to create token economies over decentralized ledgers. Such tokens can also be exchanged with other currencies, and therefore become an attractive remuneration option for infrastructure providers. When it comes to decentralized storage systems specifically, the token economy builds an open market around renting storage resources. In practice, users store their files for a period of time by paying with blockchain utility tokens that get fairly distributed among the entities that host them. This is facilitated by the blockchain consensus protocol that incentivizes providers who successfully store content, and comparably punishes those who fail to do so. One thing that we need to consider when using blockchain ledgers for human rights archives is that all storage operations are irreversibly recorded in the public blockchain history. Therefore, all publisher activity and archive metadata can be traced back in time, a property thatdespite the drawbacks mentioned belowcan be beneficial when we care about the chronological sequence of such events: systems like OpenTimestamps and hashd0x, for example, rely on blockchain records to provide trusted timestamps, content integrity and source authentication of uploaded files and their metadata. Notably, user identities in blockchains can be considered pseudonymous, given that, instead of being issued centrally, identities are derived from cryptographic public keys and therefore do not include identifying information. Yet this also means that everyone can track a pseudonymous identity's activities and potentially infer the real owners. On top of that, cryptographic key management is complex for users, and we are eager to see how techniques employed in other blockchain systems – like multisig and social recovery wallets, account abstraction, and zeroknowledge proofs for set membership – can ease adoption and improve privacy and security. These techniques require an additional feature for executing applications, called smart contracts, which is also finding its way into blockchain decentralized storage networks (see the Filecoin Virtual Machine) and opens new possibilities for decentralized applications that can operate programmably on the stored data without the need to trust any of the infrastructure providers. A significant limitation of blockchainbased decentralized storage options has to do with the actual monetary cost a community would incur for hosting their archive there. Hosting data on a global network means competing with all other applications that bid their own price for the available storage space, posing a challenge to the sustainability of the archive as prices may mount over time. Hopefully, blockchains will begin to unlock new directions in collaboration, reputation and monetization models that archiving communities can adapt to their ways. One initiative that directly taps into this potential while specifically appealing to archivists, is Alex., an archival platform that aims to preserve human history and culture built over Arweave. Alex. creates publiclyfunded decentralized archives where, in return for their tokens for renting storage space in the blockchain network, funders receive a new type of token representing their contributions – a token which can play a role in the curation and longevity of the archive by representing voting power, credibility, or other benefits to contributors and funders. Takeaways We conclude this reflection on the diverse landscape of decentralized storage technologies by highlighting some key takeaways. Firstly, decentralization fundamentally alters the dynamics of control and responsibility, aligning with participatory archiving processes essential for censorship resistance and privacy protection. However, decentralized storage isn't a onesizefitsall solution as various techniques address different aspects of archival stewardship, such as curation, dissemination, and authenticity. Moreover, the multitude of options available in decentralized storage necessitates careful consideration of tradeoffs encompassing usability, costs, security, privacy, and resilience. Despite the progress made, a cohesive framework to serve Decentralized Autonomous Communities remains elusive, highlighting the need for integration among disparate technological developments. While blockchain has garnered significant attention and investment for decentralization endeavors, its readiness to fully meet the demands of human rights archivists is still evolving. Although blockchain holds promise, particularly in ensuring integrity and authenticity, it requires further refinement to align with the specific needs of human rights archiving practices, drawing inspiration from existing systems while charting a path forward towards greater inclusivity and freedom. Finally, human rights archivists must carefully assess which decentralized technologies to use, and in what combinations, in order to best safeguard or deploy their data. As these technologies are still nascent, human rights archivists are uniquely positioned to infuse civil liberties like transparency and accountability into these technologies. Their expertise, advocacy, and active participation in the decentralized storage ecosystem can ensure that these tools are designed and implemented in a way that supports justice and makes preserving truth to power safer and more effective. Through ongoing research, advocacy, and active participation in the decentralized storage ecosystem, OpenArchive works to identify challenges and opportunities with the goal of improving upon these systems to ensure they are beneficial to human rights archivists. Benefits and Drawbacks of These Decentralized Storage Options A Deeper Dive into Benefits and Drawbacks: UserHosted Decentralized Storage Networks Benefits: Can hide user activity (anonymity) and remove liability for content they store or transfer (plausible deniability). Data is hosted by a large and diverse user base. Social trust and reputation mechanisms can marginalize adversaries and improve performance for legitimate users. Provide tools for building decentralized applications, such as social media, blogging, whistleblowing, and source code repositories Drawbacks: All users need to host data and to be constantly connected to the network. Computers joining and leaving the network make it slow and unreliable. Adversaries can attack the network from the inside – e.g. by overloading it with spam data – and can observe user activity. Users need to manage cryptographic keys. Users may lack control over what data they store or support. Delegated Decentralized Storage Networks Benefits: Convenient for users as they don’t store content themselves. Being selforganized, they offer flexible and scalable deployment. Can be public or private. Cryptographic techniques improve privacy and reliability. Drawbacks: Small group of infrastructure providers gives them more power and liability over the archive compared to the other two options. Unclear incentives for infrastructure providers. Blockchainbased Decentralized Storage Networks Benefits: In addition to the benefits of delegated systems, they also provide: High availability, resilience and resistance to censorship. Cryptocurrency tokens for incentivizing a large and diverse group of infrastructure providers. Support smart contracts for building decentralized applications. Enable new models for collaboration and financial sustainability. Can be used as a trusted timestamping service. Drawbacks: Storage costs in cryptocurrency. Users need to manage cryptographic keys. Users have pseudonymous accounts whose activity is traceable in the public blockchain history. Cannot delete actions from the blockchain history.","news/memo-from-Quito-es":"title: \"Memo desde Quito: Entendiendo las necesidades de las comunidades documentadoras de Ecuador\"description:  Las personas defensoras de los derechos humanos en Ecuador enfrentan crecientes amenazas por su trabajo en la lucha contra los abusos de las operaciones mineras.

Nuestra reciente evaluación de necesidades con la Asociación Latinoamericana para el Desarrollo Alternativo (ALDEA) ofrece información sobre las realidades, desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentan estos defensores de derechos humanos en Ecuador mientras documentan y archivan evidencia de injusticia. Durante años, los enfrentamientos por los derechos de los pueblos Indígenas en Ecuador han definido el panorama político. A pesar de la defensa que hacen personas ecuatorianas tanto del reconocimiento de los derechos Indígenas como de la agencia Indígena en todo el país, la minería en algunos pueblos rurales sigue comprometiendo la salud y seguridad de las comunidades. Esta actividad minera no solo amenaza con destruir tierras ancestrales, sino que lleva a una grave degradación de los ecosistemas locales, liberando metales tóxicos y químicos al ambiente local. Esta toxicidad contamina el agua potable y amenaza la vida de niños y adultos. La Asociación Latinoamericana para el Desarrollo Alternativo (ALDEA), una organización con sede en Quito que apoya la construcción de una sociedad inclusiva, equitativa y sostenible, es muy activa en el esfuerzo por documentar estos abusos y abogar por el cambio. OpenArchive y ALDEA han iniciado la primera fase de investigación para mapear las necesidades, riesgos y amenazas de las comunidades ecuatorianas que están registrando, recibiendo y amplificando evidencias de estas violaciones contra las comunidades Indígenas. Todas las personas encuestadas están ubicadas en Ecuador, con la mayor concentración en Quito y Esmeraldas. En junio de 2023, OpenArchive y ALDEA distribuyeron conjuntamente una encuesta de evaluación de necesidades que proporcionó información valiosa sobre los desafíos y realidades que moldean las experiencias de quienes trabajan dentro de la comunidad ecuatoriana para crear este archivo. Oportunidades de apoyo Las personas encuestadas identificaron cuatro brechas principales en recursos y capacidades que determinan su flujo de trabajo diario: recursos técnicos y oportunidades de capacitación limitadas, falta de financiamiento y otros recursos que obstaculizan la capacidad organizativa, archivos y ficheros desorganizados e inaccesibles, y una burocracia complicada que entorpece los esfuerzos de las organizaciones. El financiamiento, la asignación de recursos, la capacitación técnica, el apoyo archivístico para administrar y organizar bases de datos y la defensa externa ante agencias gubernamentales podrían desempeñar un papel significativo en mejorar la experiencia laboral de los defensores de derechos humanos ecuatorianos. Ninguno de los participantes de la encuesta utiliza actualmente aplicaciones cifradas para compartir evidencia en sus flujos de trabajo, indicando que la integración de estas herramientas en la comunidad podría tener un impacto significativo en su seguridad y en la mejora de los flujos de trabajo de preservación. OpenArchive sigue comprometida con apoyar a nuestros homólogos ecuatorianos en la realización de capacitaciones sobre: mejores prácticas archivísticas, habilidades técnicas, seguridad y expansión de la capacidad organizativa a través del uso de la aplicación Save. “Durante los últimos años hemos visto un aumento alarmante de la violencia política y los ataques contra defensores de derechos humanos en Ecuador. Esto hace que sea cada vez más importante proteger a quienes se encargan de documentar evidencias de violaciones a los derechos de los ciudadanos. Muchos de estos riesgos pueden ser mitigados al equipar a estas comunidades con herramientas de documentación seguras que fortalezcan sus esfuerzos para combatir violaciones a los derechos humanos”, expresó David Aragort, Gerente del programa de Comunidad de Archivistas Descentralizados (CAD) de OpenArchive para América Latina. Metodología ALDEA y OpenArchive recibieron 23 respuestas a la evaluación de necesidades. OpenArchive abordó el análisis de la encuesta agrupando a los participantes por roles. Este método se basa en los hallazgos de evaluaciones de necesidades anteriores a través de las cuales OpenArchive identificó tres roles clave dentro de las comunidades: documentador (el que registra y documenta evidencia de primera mano), receptor (el que supervisa y gestiona la recepción, organización y posible distribución de medios/datos) y doble rol (el que desempeña tanto un papel de documentación como de recepción en su trabajo). Panorama de amenazas y desafíos Amenazas físicas y digitales caracterizan el panorama de riesgos para los encuestados. Los documentadores identifican sus principales riesgos como amenazas de arresto por parte de las autoridades, amenazas físicas por parte de mineros y otros, amenazas ambientales (como enfermedades y animales salvajes, como serpientes y jaguares), intimidación por parte de las empresas mineras, cortes de Internet y posible pérdida o confiscación de tecnología y otros equipos de trabajo. Los receptores identifican sus principales riesgos como intentos de soborno, amenazas digitales, vigilancia, censura, cortes de Internet y amenazas de arresto. Los participantes con un doble rol mencionaron todas las amenazas anteriores, así como la criminalización de su trabajo. Conectividad y restricciones técnicas Existe una brecha digital significativa en Ecuador entre la conectividad en zonas urbanas y la conectividad inconsistente en algunos territorios Indígenas. Este desequilibrio tiene implicaciones significativas en el acceso a la información, la seguridad digital y la preservación cultural. La cobertura celular en muchas regiones Indígenas es inconsistente e inestable, a menudo incentivando a las personas a conectarse a través de WiFi, cuyo acceso también es limitado. El Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos en Ecuador informó que el 61,7% de los hogares en zonas urbanas tienen una conexión WiFi, mientras que solo el 34,7% de los hogares en zonas rurales tienen acceso a WiFi. Documentadores Muchos de los documentadores se conectan a Internet a través de WiFi en lugar de datos móviles porque hay grandes brechas en la cobertura celular en las regiones donde realizan su trabajo de documentación. Para realizar llamadas o establecer contacto mientras están en tránsito en estas áreas, algunos utilizan una conexión satelital. Sin embargo, aquellos documentadores que trabajan principalmente en ciudades más grandes a menudo usan datos móviles porque ofrecen mayor flexibilidad para la movilidad dentro de regiones con mejor cobertura. Receptores Los receptores expresaron una fuerte preferencia por el uso de WiFi. Muchos mencionaron los beneficios de seguridad y control que les ofrece el WiFi en su trabajo y también describieron los costos del WiFi como más bajos y accesibles que la mayoría de los planes de datos móviles. Doble rol Aquellos con un doble rol hicieron eco de los sentimientos de la comunidad de documentadores, expresando una preferencia por conectarse a Internet a través de WiFi mientras trabajan en territorios Indígenas y luego conectarse a través de datos móviles en ciudades más grandes. Otro hallazgo clave fue que, en promedio, los participantes de la encuesta evaluaron su capacidad técnica en 2,4 en una escala de 1 a 5. Esto indica que hay espacio para esfuerzos educativos y de divulgación que fortalezcan las capacidades técnicas de la comunidad. Personas OpenArchive está aprovechando los hallazgos de esta encuesta para mapear las necesidades y actividades de ALDEA, con el fin de construir herramientas más adaptables. Esto se realiza en gran medida a través de la creación de personas y otros métodos de investigación descritos en la metodología centrada en los derechos humanos (HRCD, por sus siglas en inglés), que nos permite descubrir y obtener una comprensión más profunda de los riesgos estructurales que ALDEA y sus socios enfrentan. Las personas se modelan según un individuo o rol particular, pero también incorporan aspectos ficticios que los investigadores utilizan para crear arquetipos que describen los patrones de comportamiento, objetivos, habilidades, actitudes e información de fondo, así como el entorno en el que opera el rol. Esta estrategia centrada en HRCD es un enfoque interseccional, seguro y protegido para desarrollar un arquetipo robusto que representa características clave relevantes para el rol.

Our recent needs assessment with the Latin American Association for Alternative Development (ALDEA) offers insight into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that these human rights defenders in Ecuador face while documenting and archiving evidence of injustice.date: 08/22/23category: Blogsimage: ALDEA_Needs_Assessment.pngregion: latamcountry: ecuador Memo from Quito: Understanding the Needs of Ecuador’s Documenter Communities Ecuadorian human rights defenders face increasing threats for their work combatting abuses by mining operations. Our recent needs assessment with the Latin American Association for Alternative Development (ALDEA) offers insight into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that these human rights defenders in Ecuador face while documenting and archiving evidence of injustice. Clashes over Indigenous people’s rights in Ecuador have shaped the political landscape for years. Despite Ecuadorians’ advocacy for both the recognition of Indigenous rights and Indigenous agency across the country, mining in some rural villages continues to compromise the communities’ health and safety. This mining activity not only threatens to destroy ancestral lands, but leads to severe degradation of the local ecosystems, releasing toxic metals and chemicals into the local environment. This toxicity contaminates drinking water and threatens the life of children and adults. The Latin American Association for Alternative Development (ALDEA) – a Quitobased organization supporting the construction of an inclusive, equitable and sustainable society – is very active in the effort to document these abuses and advocate for change. OpenArchive and ALDEA have launched the first phase of research to map the needs, risks, and threats of the Ecuadorian communities who are recording, receiving, and amplifying evidence of these violations against Indigenous communities. All of the respondents are based in Ecuador, with the majority concentrated in Quito and Esmeraldas. In June 2023, OpenArchive and ALDEA jointly circulated a needs assessment survey that yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working within the Ecuadorian community to create this archive. Opportunities for Support The survey respondents identified four primary gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: limited technical resources and training opportunities, a lack of funding and other resources, disorganized and inaccessible archives and files, and complicated bureaucracy. Funding, resource allocation, technical training, archival support to manage and organize databases, and external advocacy to government agencies could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for Ecuadorian human rights defenders. None of the survey participants are currently using encrypted evidencesharing apps within their workflows, indicating that the integration of these tools into the community may have notable impact on their safety and improved preservation workflows. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Ecuadorian counterparts in facilitating trainings on: best archival practices, technical skills, security, and expanding organizational capacity through use of the Save app. “In recent years, Ecuador has witnessed a concerning increase in political violence and attacks on human rights defenders. This highlights the crucial need to protect those documenting evidence of citizens' rights violations. Many of these risks can be mitigated by equipping communities with the right secure documentation tools to enhance their efforts to combat human rights abuses.” said David Aragort, OpenArchive’s Latin America DAC Manager. Methods ALDEA and OpenArchive received 23 responses to the needs assessment. OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the reception, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Threat Landscape and Challenges Physical and digital threats characterize the risk landscape for the survey respondents. Documenters identify their primary risks as threats of arrest from authorities, physical threats from miners and others, environmental threats (such as diseases and animals like snakes and jaguars), intimidation from corporate leadership at mining companies, Internet outages, and potential loss or confiscation of technology and other equipment. Receivers identify their primary risks as attempted bribery, digital threats, surveillance, censorship, Internet outages, and threats of arrest. Participants in a dualrole named all the threats listed above as well as facing criminalization of their work. Connectivity and Technical Constraints A significant digital divide exists in Ecuador between connectivity in urban areas and inconsistent connectivity in some Indigenous territories. This imbalance has meaningful implications on access to information, digital security, and cultural preservation. Cellular coverage in many Indigenous regions is inconsistent and unstable, often incentivizing people to connect through WiFi, which is also limited. The National Institute of Statistics and Census in Ecuador reported that 61.7% of households in urban areas have a WiFi connection, while 34.7% of households in rural areas have WiFi access. Documenters Many of the documenters connect to the Internet via WiFi instead of cellular data because there are large gaps in cellular coverage in the regions in which they are doing their documentation work. For placing calls or making contact while in transit in these areas, some use a satellite connection. However, those documenters that work primarily in larger cities often use data because it offers more flexibility for mobility within regions with better coverage. Receivers The receivers expressed a strong preference for WiFi usage. Many named the security and control benefits that WiFi offers them in their work and also described WiFi costs as being lower and more accessible than most cellular data plans. Dualrole Those in a dualrole echoed the sentiments of the documenter community, expressing a preference for connecting to the Internet via WiFi while working in Indigenous territories and then connecting via cellular data in larger cities. Another key finding was that, on average, survey participants assessed their technical capacity to be 2.4 on a scale of 1 to 5. This indicates that there is space for educational and outreach efforts to strengthen the community’s technical capabilities. User Personas OpenArchive is leveraging the findings from this survey to map ALDEA’s needs and activities in order to build more responsive tools. This is largely conducted through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology, which allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that the ALDEA and its partners’ experience. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role, but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which the role operates. This HRCDfocused strategy is an intersectional, safe, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype that represents key characteristics relevant to the role.

Free speech in Iraq is under severe threat, this time due to drafted digital content regulation that could criminalize investigative journalism and undermine free speech. This dangerous regulation is part of Iraq’s history of internet blocking/shutdowns, website filtering/blocking, censorship, and targeting of human rights defenders and eyewitnesses, all of which significantly impact the safety and work of those documenting and archiving injustices. OpenArchive and the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSMIraq) – the first network of digital rights defenders and experts in Iraq – have launched the first phase of research to map the needs, risks, and threats of the Iraqi documenter community. In the Spring of 2023, OpenArchive and INSM jointly circulated a needs assessment survey that yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working within the Republic of Iraq and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI). The survey was broadly circulated to INSMIraq’s networks and with over 80 responses, the research outputs represent the diversity of the community and offer OpenArchive a robust dataset to consider the best modes and mechanisms to develop and deliver support to these human rights defenders. Opportunities for Support Iraqi survey respondents identified three primary gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: a lack of technical resources and trainings (especially with respect to digital security and protecting sensitive data), outdated and insecure devices and technologies, and gaps in legal protections. Funding, resource allocation, delivering updated and secure technology, technical training (especially digital security training), and legislative advocacy – to reject the draft digital content regulation and advance protections for documenters – could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for Iraqi human rights defenders. “We learned from the 2019 Iraqi demonstrations that internet outages severely affected the documentation process. In response, we quickly adapted our technology and approach to collect evidence of human rights violations throughout the region during connectivity shutdowns. In continuing this effort to strengthen our documentation work, we are eager to identify and address the ongoing challenges of our community,” says Hayder Hamzoz, founder of INSMIraq. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Iraqi counterparts and facilitating trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in precarious landscapes to help fill some of the existing gaps identified by those on the ground. Likewise, INSMIraq continues to host digital security workshops and discussions to tackle these issues. Additionally, nearly 30% of the survey respondents were already active Save users. Building on this, in the coming months, OpenArchive and INSM will hold trainings and workshops to receive feedback on the app and better understand how we can serve Iraqi documenters and archivists. Methods OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the reception, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Threat Landscape for Iraqi Human Rights Defenders Survey respondents face a complex threat landscape comprising a variety of physical and digital risks. Many of the participants had experienced these risks firsthand. Those working primarily in receiver roles tended to face digital threats such as hacking, misinformation, malware, surveillance, and insecure digital storage. For those who work in documenter roles, these risks also included physical threats, physical attacks, arrest, torture, and facing the confiscation of their technology and devices. One respondent detailed a violent incident from the October 2019 demonstrations when they were “beaten and electrocuted…then, the most important thing, which was the memory card for the camera, was confiscated.” Another, also arrested during the 2019 October demonstrations, was “subjected to interrogation through the confiscation of my phone and the pictures in it from journalists.” Many respondents shared their personal experience with being hacked, censored, and surveilled. Connectivity Constraints The most prevalent frustration among documenters is inconsistent access to the internet. The documenters are evenly split in their preference for WiFi vs. mobile data, but many respondents note that their preferences are shaped by the circumstances (access to secure WiFi networks, size of data packages, etc.). Every documenter noted that they access the internet all or most of the time (58% all the time, 42% most of the time), and the majority have unlimited data plans to connect to mobile internet. The receivers are evenly split in their preference for WiFi vs. mobile data, but many receivers also remark that their preferences are shaped by the circumstances. Fifty percent of receivers have access to the internet all the time. Thirtysix percent of receivers have access to the internet most of the time. The remaining 14% noted that their access is only available some of the time or rarely. The majority of receivers have unlimited data plans to connect to mobile internet. Nearly all respondents in the dualrole category preferred to connect by mobile internet/data. Multiple respondents noted that relying on mobile data provides consistency across geographies locations, which in turn makes mobility easier. User Personas and Use Cases OpenArchive is now leveraging the findings from the survey to map INSMIraq’s needs and activities in order to build a more responsive framework. This is largely being conducted through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology, that allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that INSMIraq and its partners experience.

Nuestra reciente evaluación de necesidades con Cubalex ofrece una perspectiva de las realidades, desafíos y oportunidades que las personas defensoras de derechos humanos enfrentan en el contexto cubano al documentar y archivar evidencias de injusticias. En años recientes, el gobierno cubano ha respondido a las críticas públicas con brutal represión y violencia. Los grupos disidentes enfrentan muchas amenazas, como restricciones a la libertad de expresión y el acceso a la información, lo que incluye el bloqueo a sitios web y plataformas de redes sociales, así como también detenciones y encarcelamientos arbitrarios, penas de prisión desproporcionadas para personas privadas de libertad por razones políticas, restricciones de viaje y más. Es particularmente preocupante la negativa del gobierno cubano a reconocer el monitoreo de derechos humanos como una actividad legítima. El gobierno también ha atacado a grupos de derechos civiles como los colectivos de artistas Movimiento San Isidro (MSI) y 27N. Estas acciones de las autoridades cubanas, junto con las restricciones a la libertad de expresión y el acceso a la información, dificultan la capacidad de compartir evidencia de la represión violenta del gobierno contra la disidencia, que a menudo se presenta. Cubalex es una de las principales organizaciones que documenta abusos contra manifestantes y otros personas defensoras de derechos humanos en Cuba. Una de sus principales prioridades es la documentación. Por lo tanto, un gran volumen de recursos de la organización se centra en recopilar y mantener evidencias de forma segura. OpenArchive y Cubalex iniciaron la primera fase de investigación para mapear las necesidades, riesgos y amenazas de las comunidades en Cuba y en cualquier otro lugar que están registrando, recibiendo y amplificando evidencias de estas violaciones en el contexto cubano. La encuesta de evaluación de necesidades, completada en julio de 2023, proporcionó información valiosa sobre los desafíos y realidades que moldean las experiencias de quienes trabajan dentro de la comunidad cubana para crear este archivo. La mayoría de las personas encuestadas son miembros de la diáspora, quienes han dejado Cuba debido a una miríada de factores, incluyendo la seguridad personal, pero aún así se apasionan por sacar a la luz evidencia sobre las violaciones de los derechos humanos por parte del gobierno cubano. Oportunidades de apoyo La encuesta identificó la privacidad como una preocupación principal para la mayoría de las personas encuestadas. Se les pidió que calificaran la importancia de software y herramientas de privacidad, como aplicaciones de mensajería cifrada y VPNs, en una escala del uno al cinco. El 72 por ciento de las personas clasificó la privacidad con un cinco, indicando que la comunidad valoraría mucho el apoyo y formación adicionales en privacidad para mantenerse a salvo y a su trabajo. Ninguna de las personas encuestadas usa actualmente aplicaciones cifradas para compartir evidencias en sus flujos de trabajo. Esta es una oportunidad para que OpenArchive proporcione apoyo en formación, desarrollo de habilidades e integración de herramientas de archivo seguras,  para que puedan protegerse mejor y a sus contenidos multimedia. Las personas encuestadass con base en Cuba también identificaron la conectividad a Internet como un desafío significativo. Un Internet irregular e inconsistente no solo crea limitaciones para documentar, conservar y analizar medios, sino que también lleva a mayores riesgos relacionados con la pérdida de datos y la dependencia de conexiones de red inseguras. OpenArchive sigue comprometido en apoyar a  nuestras contrapartes en Cuba facilitando formación en las mejores prácticas de archivo, habilidades técnicas, seguridad y expandiendo la capacidad organizativa a través de la aplicación Save. “La documentación y archivo de violaciones de derechos humanos ha permitido a Cubalex visibilizar, sensibilizar y reconstruir la memoria histórica en Cuba. La seguridad y protección de la información es parte de las garantías que necesitan las víctimas para ejercer y disfrutar su derecho a la verdad, la justicia y la reparación. Agradecemos a OpenArchive la oportunidad para mejorar nuestro sistema de archivo y su contribución para que los horrores del pasado y presente en Cuba no se repitan en el futuro”, expresó Laritza Diversent, Directora Ejecutiva de Cubalex. Metodología OpenArchive abordó el análisis de la encuesta agrupando a las personas participantes por función. Este método se basa en hallazgos de evaluaciones de necesidades anteriores a través de las cuales OpenArchive identificó tres roles clave dentro de las comunidades, se encuentran quienes: documentan ( registra y documenta evidencia de primera mano), reciben (supervisa y gestiona la recepción, organización y posible distribución de medios/datos) y con  doble rol (desempeña un papel tanto de documentación como de recepción en su trabajo). Cubalex y OpenArchive recibieron dieciocho respuestas a la evaluación de necesidades. Dos de estas personas encuestadas se encontraban en Cuba, mientras que las demás residen en otros lugares. Panorama de amenazas y desafíos Las personas encuestadas enfrentan amenazas físicas y digitales. Quienes documentan identifican sus principales riesgos como amenazas digitales, cibervigilancia, hackeo, difamación, vigilancia física, ataques físicos, encarcelamiento, interrogatorio, prohibición de entrada a Cuba y el ataque a sus familiares. Quienes reciben identifican sus principales riesgos como amenazas digitales, vigilancia, hackeo, desacreditación/difamación, prohibición de entrada a Cuba, amenazas a familiares que todavía están en Cuba, impactos negativos en la salud mental y pérdida de datos. Quienes tienenbase en Cuba señalan riesgos adicionales de cortes de Internet, ataques del gobierno, encarcelamiento y exilio. Aquellas personas con doble rol identifican sus principales riesgos como amenazas digitales, prohibición de entrada a Cuba, ataques del gobierno y cortes de Internet en Cuba, que impiden el acceso a información necesaria y la conexión con las víctimas. Conectividad y restricciones técnicas El gobierno cubano frecuentemente interrumpe el acceso a Internet para reprimir la disidencia. En julio de 2021, en medio de protestas contra el gobierno, el servicio de Internet fue interrumpido por dos noches. Aplicaciones de mensajería como Signal, Telegram y WhatsApp, junto con plataformas de redes sociales, también fueron restringidas. Esto es particularmente represivo ya que las autoridades cubanas controlan la única empresa de telecomunicaciones del país. Se observaron diferencias de conectividad entre quienes están en Cuba y quienes están en otros lugares, pero no variaron significativamente según el papel del usuario. La gran mayoría de las personas encuestadas prefirieron conectarse a Internet a través de WiFi. Sin embargo, quienes están en Cuba prefirieron usar datos móviles en lugar de WiFi por razones de seguridad y protección. Si bien la conectividad no es identificada como un desafío significativo para quienes están fuera de Cuba, vale la pena señalar que los cortes y restricciones de Internet dentro del país pueden afectar la capacidad de comunicarse con quienes están en el terreno y exacerbar las preocupaciones sobre pérdida de datos, dependencia del WiFi y conexiones de red inseguras. Además, las personas encuestadas indicaron que tenían una capacidad técnica media de tres en una escala del uno al cinco. Esto indica espacio para esfuerzos educativos y de divulgación para fortalecer las capacidades técnicas de la comunidad. Personas OpenArchive está aprovechando los hallazgos de esta encuesta para mejorar nuestras herramientas y hacerlas más adaptablesa las necesidades de Cubalex. Hemos evaluado cuidadosamente sus amenazas, necesidades, capacidades técnicas y flujos de trabajo de archivo actuales a través de la creación de personas y otros métodos de investigación descritos en la metodología de diseño centrado en los derechos humanos (HRCD, por sus siglas en inglés). Esto nos permite obtener una comprensión más profunda de los daños estructurales que experimentan Cubalex y sus organizaciones aliadas  y adaptar nuestras herramientas para garantizar su protección y la de sus contenidos multimedia. Las personas se modelan a partir de un individuo o rol particular, pero también incorporan aspectos ficticios que el equipo investigador utiliza para crear arquetipos que describen los patrones de comportamiento, objetivos, habilidades, actitudes, información de fondo y el entorno en el que opera el rol. Esta estrategia de HRCD es un enfoque interseccional, exhaustivo y seguro para desarrollar un arquetipo robusto que represente características clave relevantes para el rol.

Our recent needs assessment with Cubalex offers insight into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that human rights defenders in the Cuban context face while documenting and archiving evidence of injustice.date: 11/27/23category: Blogsimage: CubalexBlog/1.pngregion: latamcountry: cuba Memo from Havana: Examining the needs of documenter communities working in Cuba Cuban human rights defenders face increasing threats for documenting government repression and violence. Our recent needs assessment with Cubalex offers insight into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that human rights defenders in the Cuban context face while documenting and archiving evidence of injustice. The Cuban government has responded to public criticism with brutal repression and violence in recent years. Dissidents face many threats, such as restrictions on freedom of expression and access to information, which include the blocking of websites and social media sites, as well as arbitrary detention and imprisonment, disproportionate prison sentences for political prisoners, travel restrictions, and more. Of particular concern is the Cuban government’s refusal to recognize human rights monitoring as legitimate. The government has also targeted civil rights groups like the San Isidro Movement (MSI) and 27N artists collectives. These actions by Cuban authorities, alongside restrictions to freedom of expression and access to information, hinder the ability to share evidence of the government’s often violent repression of dissent. Cubalex is one of the primary organizations documenting abuse against protesters and other human rights defenders in Cuba. Since one of their top priorities is documentation, much of the organization’s resources are focused on safely collecting and maintaining evidence. OpenArchive and Cubalex launched the first of two research phases to map the needs, risks, and threats of the communities in Cuba and elsewhere that are recording, receiving, and amplifying evidence of these violations in the Cuban context. The needs assessment survey, completed in July 2023, yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working in and with the Cuban community to create this archive. A majority of the survey respondents are members of the diaspora community, who have left Cuba due to myriad factors, including personal safety, but are still passionate about bringing evidence to light about the Cuban government’s human rights violations. Opportunities for Support The survey identified privacy as a top concern for most respondents. We asked respondents to rate the importance of privacy software and tools — like encrypted messaging apps and VPNs — on a scale of one to five. In fact, 72 percent of respondents ranked privacy a five, indicating the community would greatly value additional privacy support and training to help keep them and their work safe. None of the respondents currently use encrypted apps to share evidence in their workflows. This is an opportunity for OpenArchive to provide support for training, skill development, and integrating secure archiving tools to better protect them and their media. Respondents based in Cuba also identified internet connectivity to be a significant challenge. Spotty and inconsistent internet not only creates limitations to documenting, preserving, and analyzing media but also leads to further risks related to data loss and reliance on insecure network connections. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Cuban counterparts by facilitating training on best archival practices, technical skills, digital security, and expanding organizational capacity through the Save app. “The documentation and archiving of human rights violations have allowed Cubalex to raise awareness, sensitize the public, and reconstruct the historical memory in Cuba. The security and protection of information are part of the guarantees that victims need to exercise and enjoy their right to truth, justice, and reparation. We appreciate OpenArchive's opportunity to improve our archiving system and its contribution to ensuring that the horrors of the past and present in Cuba are not repeated in the future,” said Laritza Diversent, Executive Director of Cubalex. Methods OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the receipt, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Cubalex and OpenArchive received eighteen responses to the needs assessment. Two of these respondents are based in Cuba, while the others reside elsewhere. Threat Landscape and Challenges Survey respondents face both physical and digital threats. Documenters identify their primary risks as digital threats, cybersurveillance, hacking, defamation, physical surveillance, physical attacks, imprisonment, interrogation, prohibition of reentry into Cuba, and the targeting of their family members. Receivers identify their primary risks as digital threats, surveillance, hacking, discrediting/defamation, prohibition of entry into Cuba, threats to family members who are in Cuba, negative impacts on mental health, and data loss. Receivers based in Cuba note additional risks of internet shutdowns, government attacks, imprisonment and exile. Those in a dual role identify their primary risks as digital threats, prohibition from entry to Cuba, attacks from the government, and internet shutdowns in Cuba, which prevent access to necessary information and connection to victims. Connectivity and Technical Constraints The Cuban government frequently disrupts internet access to suppress dissent. In July 2021, amid antigovernment protests, authorities shut down the internet for two nights. Messaging apps like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp, alongside social media platforms, were also restricted. This is particularly repressive as Cuban authorities control the country’s only telecommunications network. Connectivity differences were observed between those based in Cuba and those based elsewhere but did not vary significantly based on the user’s role. Most of the respondents outside of Cuba preferred to connect to the internet via WiFi. However, the respondents in Cuba preferred to use cellular data over WiFi for security and safety reasons. While connectivity is not identified as a significant challenge for those outside of Cuba, it is worth noting that internet shutdowns and restrictions inside the country can affect the ability to communicate with those on the ground and exacerbate concerns over data loss, reliance on WiFi, and insecure network connections. Lastly, given that survey respondents indicated they had a median technical ability of three on a scale from one to five, there is an opportunity for educational and outreach efforts to strengthen the community’s technical capabilities. User Personas OpenArchive is leveraging the findings from this survey to enhance our tools to be more responsive to Cubalex’s needs. We have carefully assessed their threats, needs, technical capacities, and current archival workflows through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology. This allows us to gain deeper insight into the structural harms that Cubalex and its partners experience and enables us to adapt our tools to better protect them and their media. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, background information, and the environment in which the role operates. This HRCD strategy is an intersectional, thorough, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype representing key characteristics relevant to the role.

The realities of working as a human rights documenter in an active war zone are complex and often unique to specific regions and contexts. Building on a year of partnership, the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) and OpenArchive have set out on a joint initiative to map some of these realities and create tools that can empower local activist and archivist communities to conduct their work as efficiently and safely as possible, while accounting for the particular challenges and characteristics of conflict zones in Ukraine. A recent needs assessment – designed, developed, and administered by KHPG and OpenArchive – offers an insightful glimpse into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that Ukrainian human rights defenders are facing in their efforts to document and expose war crimes and hold perpetrators to account. While a survey can of course never completely capture the range and depth of experiences, it has already proven a useful tool to map the risk landscape for the team in Ukraine – especially those concentrated in the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Khmelnytskyi – and consider the best modes and mechanisms to develop and deliver support to history’s first responders. Needs and Opportunities for Support KHPG survey respondents identified four gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: a lack of technical and financial resources (especially with respect to file storage systems), imperfect technical operations of database systems, incomplete information regarding attacks and hostilities, and poor communication due inconsistent technical capacities and capabilities among colleagues. Funding, resource allocation, technical training, digital tools, and communication platforms could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for KHPG staff. “In the very beginning of the Russian invasion, we managed to quickly build a dedicated database and then create a strong network of documenters. Now it's time to carefully analyze our workflow to see if we can make it more productive and safe,” says Denys Volokha, KHPG’s Media Director. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our KHPG counterparts and facilitating trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones to help fill some of the existing gaps identified by those on the ground. Overview of Findings & Risk Landscape for KHPG Team and Partners in Ukraine The sample of 24 individuals captured a broad range of roles within the community – including lawyers, documenters, database managers, and project managers – and a shared commitment to documenting war crimes and holding perpetrators to account. Nearly 92% of survey respondents are presently based in Ukraine and 54% of total respondents focus their work efforts on the Kharkiv region in particular, either remotely or locally. The region is located in northeast Ukraine and borders Russia, which makes it extremely vulnerable. From February to September 2022, almost half of the region’s territory was under Russian occupation. Sixtythree percent of all respondents work directly for KHPG while the remaining participants were affiliated with partner organizations. In 2022, several dozen nonprofit organizations joined their efforts in a global initiative “Tribunal for Putin” (“T4P” in short) to document war crimes committed by Russia in the territory of Ukraine in the joint database using KHPG’s methodology. All survey participants identified their primary goals as one, or both, of the following: documenting war crimes and/or offering legal assistance to prosecute those accountable for war crimes. The survey yielded key information on the framework of communication and connection within the archivist community. Seventynine percent of survey respondents receive multimedia evidence directly from eyewitnesses, most commonly via instant messaging applications (like WhatsApp and Signal), social media platforms, and custom databases. The majority of participants use OneDrive or Google Drive to store the received media, while a handful of respondents (22%) opt to save files directly on their computers. Colleagues, citizen journalists, media outlets, general public, and local NGOs, were other key sources within this network of media collection that respondents identified. The mechanisms through which the large volumes of media intake is achieved is primarily through mobile footage (80.3% of respondents), Telegram scraping (70.8% of respondents), YouTube (66.7% of respondents), Facebook scraping (62.5% of respondents), and documents (50% of respondents). Shelling, air raids, landmines, and violent arrests – perpetrated by Russia and its occupying forces – are a few of the physical risks that respondents named that shape their daily working realities within Ukraine. These physical threats in turn create a landscape of precarious infrastructure that contributes to digital risks. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has recently called on Russia to observe international humanitarian law, explicitly with regards to protecting critical civilian infrastructure, such as energy facilities and hydroelectric power stations. Recent missile attacks have already compromised energy sources throughout Ukraine posing severe risks to the population, and the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) warns that future strikes could lead to further deterioration. Nearly 48% of the survey respondents identified power outages and internet disruptions as key threats that interrupt their connectivity and threaten their security and the security of their sources, colleagues, and work content. Respondents’ connectivity preferences and accessibility map onto these realities and tend to vary based on role, location, environment. Those respondents that capture evidence firsthand – in the form of mobile media, testimonials, and/or primary source research – often lack any internet connection on the ground. When connection is possible on the ground, these respondents expressed a strong preference to connect via mobile data and then once in a physically safe location, they typically prefer to use secure WiFi networks to upload and organize evidence. Those that organize, maintain, and use the firsthand evidence are often stationary and can safely connect to a consistent and secure internet connection via WiFi. Email attacks, censorship, hacking, digital surveillance and interception, and compromised confidentiality all influence the contours of the digital risk landscape in addition to the physical threats caused by wartime hostilities. While documenting abuses/incidents on the ground, 50% of respondents have experienced data loss, 25% have faced phone confiscation, 25% have struggled with internet connectivity, 12.5% have encountered malware or hacking, 8.3% have had their information compromised, and nearly 5% have experienced WiFi interception. User Personas and Use Cases OpenArchive is now leveraging the findings from the survey to map KHPG’s needs and activities in order to build a more responsive framework. This is largely being conducted through user persona building, a humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) research method that allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that KHPG and its partners experience. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role, but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which the role operates. This HRCDfocused strategy is an intersectional, safe, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype that represents key characteristics relevant to the role.

In recent weeks, the escalating conflict in Sudan has resulted in thousands of casualties and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and country. In April 2023, civilians faced an extreme internet outage, during which nearly all connectivity collapsed due to “power shortages and difficulty supplying backup generators amid heavy weapons strikes on population centers.” This current reality in Sudan is tied to a notable history of internet blocking/shutdowns, website filtering/blocking, censorship, and targeting of human rights defenders and eyewitnesses – a reality that impacts the safety and work of those documenting and archiving injustices. OpenArchive and a Sudanese NGO – who wishes to remain anonymous due to security concerns – have launched the first research phase which maps the needs, risks, and threats of the Sudanese documenter community. This needs assessment was conducted prior to the conflict that began in April In the Spring of 2023, OpenArchive and the Sudanese NGO jointly launched a needs assessment survey that yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working within Sudan. “This critical documentation work in Sudan started long ago throughout multiple crises over the last decades. Our research findings are even more valuable now that we have a lens into the groups’ archiving practices during active conflict. It is important for OpenArchive and human rights NGOs working in Sudan to understand how these brave documenters do this essential work,” said Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Executive director of OpenArchive. “Through this research, we can more effectively assist their evidentiary archiving efforts in meaningful and impactful ways to bring accountability and justice against the powerful forces oppressing the people of Sudan.” Opportunities for Support Sudanese survey respondents identified three gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: insecure archival practices, technologies and software that don’t prioritize privacy, and a lack of security training and resources. Funding, resource allocation, distributing secure devices, updating software, and technical training (especially digital security training and archival training) could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for Sudanese human rights defenders. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Sudanese counterparts, especially during this time of crisis and conflict. In an effort to respond to the situation on the ground, OpenArchive is expediting the local deployment of the Save app and trainings to the Sudanese Decentralized Archivist Community (DAC). Methods OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the reception, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Threat Landscape and Challenges Physical and digital threats characterize the risk landscape for the survey respondents. Documenters identify their primary risks as data loss, phone confiscation, arrest, attack, and inconsistent access to the internet due to power outages. Receivers identify their primary risks as data loss, compromised quality of multimedia materials, hacking, misinformation, and internet outages/inconsistent connectivity. Most participants in a dualrole responded that all the above risks affected them, indicating that, with this role’s many responsibilities, those who play a dualrole experience the broadest spectrum of threats. Connectivity and Technical Constraints Data loss and internet outages are the two risks that are universally identified as relevant across all three categories, demanding a closer investigation of the community’s connectivity. Connectivity challenges pose a significant hurdle in the efforts of documenters and receivers alike. Spotty and inconsistent internet not only creates limitations to documenting, preserving, and analyzing media, but also leads to further risks related to data loss and reliance on insecure network connections. Internet usage and access remains low in Sudan with 31% of the population using the internet as of 2022. Major mobile service providers – such as Zain or Sudani – have experienced longterm outages and geographical gaps in coverage. Pair these circumstances with unreliable electricity, and connectivity is often severely strained. Rolling power outages are common in cities and rural areas experience sporadic electricity access at best. Documenters Over half (57%) of documenters from our sample do not have access to WiFi and prefer to connect to the internet via mobile data. However, despite the low rate of WiFi connection, all the documenters noted that they access the internet all the time (57%) or most of the time (43%). Receivers While the majority (60%) of receivers do have access to WiFi, almost all prefer to connect to the internet via mobile data. Only 50% of receivers have access to the internet all the time (30% of receivers have access some of the time and 20% have access most of the time). Dual Role The majority (62.5%) of those in a dualrole do have access to WiFi. Interestingly, 50% of those in a dualrole do not have a preference regarding the mode of connectivity, while 37.5% prefer WiFi and 12.5% prefer to connect via mobile data. A quarter of dualrole workers have access to the internet most of the time, 12.5% have access some of the time, and 62.5% have access all the time. Given these circumstances, the most prevalent frustration among the full sample is inconsistent connectivity. To manage the uncertain conditions, survey respondents often have large mobile data plans (up to 500 GB/month) to boost connectivity opportunities. Another key finding was that, on average, survey participants assessed their technical capacity to be a 2.3 on a scale of 1 to 5.This indicates that there is space for educational and outreach efforts to strengthen the community’s technical capabilities. Despite lower technical capacity assessments, 92% of respondents noted that they would be willing to adopt new technologies, indicating an openness to tools and trainings that could advance the community’s efforts to defend human rights. User Personas OpenArchive is leveraging the findings from this survey to map the Sudanese DAC’s needs and activities in order to build a more responsive tools. This is largely conducted through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology, which allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that the Sudanese organization and its partners’ experience. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role, but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which the role operates. This HRCDfocused strategy is an intersectional, safe, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype that represents key characteristics relevant to the role.

Nuestra reciente evaluación de necesidades con Data Cívica brinda información sobre las realidades, desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentan activistas, periodistas y testigos en México al documentar y archivar evidencia de violencia e injusticia. Este otoño, OpenArchive lanzó su colaboración con Data Cívica. Data Cívica utiliza datos y tecnología para fortalecer el periodismo y la sociedad civil en México mientras combaten la violencia de género, ayudan en la búsqueda de personas desaparecidas, documentan y preservan evidencia, y aumentan la transparencia y rendición de cuentas. OpenArchive y Data Cívica completaron la fase de investigación de su colaboración en octubre. En esta etapa se mapearon las necesidades, riesgos y amenazas de las comunidades que están registrando, recibiendo y amplificando evidencia de violaciones a los derechos humanos en el país. México es uno de los países más peligrosos para que periodistas y personas defensoras de los derechos humanos operen. Según Human Rights Watch, \"quienes critican a funcionarios públicos o exponen el trabajo de cárteles criminales a menudo enfrentan ataques, hostigamiento y vigilancia por parte de autoridades gubernamentales y grupos criminales\". El año pasado, una investigación periodística  reveló que el ejército, cuyo poder se ha expandido en los últimos años, estaba utilizando el spyware Pegasus  para espiar a rivales políticos, periodistas y personas defensoras de los derechos humanos. La policía y el ejército también pueden recurrir a la tortura para obtener información o confesiones ilícitas. Según los resultados de la Encuesta Nacional de Población Privada de la Libertad de 2021, se encontró que casi la mitad de las personas encuestadas fueron víctimas de abuso físico después de su arresto. Cada año, la policía, el ejército y grupos del crimen organizado \"desaparecen\" miles de personas en México. Hasta el año 2022, se registran 105,000 personas desaparecidas. Otros problemas clave en el país incluyen altos niveles de violencia de género y feminicidio, violencia militar contra civiles y abusos dentro del sistema de justicia penal, incluyendo la detención preventiva y las precarias condiciones carcelarias. Muchas de estas violaciones están ocultas u oscurecidas porque el gobierno dificulta que los ciudadanos compartan y accedan a información pública, obstaculizando así el conocimiento sobre estas e impidiendo la justicia. Debido tanto al alto nivel de violaciones como a la falta de acceso a pruebas de las mismas, hay una creciente necesidad de que testigos presenciales y activistas puedan documentar, verificar y compartir pruebas de abusos a los derechos humanos. Nuestra encuesta de evaluación de necesidades proporcionó información útil sobre los desafíos y realidades que dan forma a las experiencias de quienes trabajan para documentar abusos en México. Panorama de amenazas y desafíos Las personas encuestadas enfrentan amenazas tanto físicas como digitales. Reportaron riesgos de peligro físico si su identidad es revelada, también riesgos para sus contactos y sus contenidos multimedia si les confiscan los dispositivos. Además señalaron que enfrentan amenazas de seguridad digital, como malware, vigilancia y hackeo. Profundizando más, las personas encuestadas cuyo papel principal era documentar abusos a los derechos humanos también se preocupan por la potencia y seguridad de su conexión a Internet. Las personas encuestadas que principalmente reciben, organizan y analizan materiales indicaron que también enfrentan dificultades para acceder y corroborar información pública del gobierno. Mientras tanto, las personas encuestadas cuyos trabajos involucran tanto documentar como recibir contenidos multimedia añadieron que tienen dificultades para equilibrar la seguridad con la usabilidad en sus métodos, lo que conduce a flujos de trabajo engorrosos. Conectividad y restricciones técnicas La conectividad a Internet está creciendo en el país. Hasta el 2021, el 76 por ciento de las personas en México tenían acceso a Internet. La red móvil 5G también se está expandiendo, especialmente en la Ciudad de México. Sin embargo, el acceso a Internet es costoso y está disponible de manera desigual en todo el país, lo que impide que personas de bajos ingresos, comunidades rurales e indígenas accedan a Internet al mismo ritmo de quienes viven en zonas urbanas o más acomodadas. A pesar del aumento del acceso a Internet, aún existen barreras para un entorno en línea abierto. Las autoridades mexicanas intentan influir en las narrativas en línea a través de la eliminación de contenido que critique al gobierno y la amplificación no auténtica de contenido a favor. Además, el uso del software espía Pegasus para vigilar a quienes critican el gobierno tiene implicaciones preocupantes para las libertades de expresión, asociación y reunión. Un reciente estudio del Parlamento Europeo examinó el impacto del software espía Pegasus en los derechos humanos y la democracia. Se encontró que el software espía Pegasus tenía impactos significativos en la participación política, y quienes son \"espiados pueden sentirse obligados a abstenerse de participar en interacciones con contenido político, a expresar sinceramente sus opiniones y a asociarse con otros con fines políticos\". En general, hubo una clara preferencia entre quienes participaron en nuestra encuesta por conectarse a Internet mediante una conexión WiFi segura, debido al alto costo de los datos de telefonía móvil. Sin embargo, señalaron que en casos donde no podían estar convencidos de la seguridad de una red WiFi, preferirían utilizar datos móviles en lugar de una red WiFi no segura. Las personas encuestadas indicaron una división bastante equitativa con el uso de Android y iPhone. Finalmente, dado que las personas encuestadas indicaron tener una habilidad técnica promedio de tres en una escala del uno al cinco, hay una oportunidad para esfuerzos educativos y de divulgación que fortalezcan las capacidades técnicas de la comunidad. Oportunidades de apoyo La seguridad personal y la privacidad tanto en línea como fuera de línea son las principales preocupaciones de las personas encuestadas.  A pesar de tener un interés en herramientas de privacidad, el 95 por ciento no utiliza aplicaciones de mensajería cifrada para enviar o recibir contenido multimedia. Muchas las personas que respondieron la encuesta tampoco utilizan redes privadas virtuales (VPN, por sus siglas en inglés). Además, las personas encuestadas indicaron que se beneficiarían de herramientas de flujo de trabajo que mejoraren su capacidad para archivar y preservar medios de manera segura sin sacrificar la privacidad o la usabilidad. También mostraron interés en aprender más sobre opciones de servidores. Esto representa una oportunidad para que OpenArchive brinde apoyo para la formación, el desarrollo de habilidades e integrar herramientas seguras de archivo que les  protejan mejor y a sus contenidos multimedia. Con este fin, en octubre de 2023, OpenArchive llevó a cabo una pequeña sesión de capacitación para personas instructoras con el personal de Data Cívica sobre las mejores prácticas archivísticas, habilidades técnicas, seguridad digital y la expansión de la capacidad organizativa a través de la aplicación Save. Data Cívica está organizando talleres comunitarios en noviembre y diciembre para compartir este conocimiento y capacitar a otras personas que trabajan para preservar y amplificar pruebas de injusticias. Desde Data Cívica comentaron que: \"Las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, periodistas y personas defensoras de los derechos humanos en México han mostrado un amplio interés en conocer más sobre la aplicación Save. La consideran una prioridad debido a los riesgos que enfrentan a diario y a su falta de conocimiento y tiempo para resolver situaciones urgentes de violaciones de derechos humanos. En este sentido, compartir información fácil de usar y sencilla entre OpenArchive y Data Cívica es increíblemente valioso\". Metodología OpenArchive abordó el análisis de la encuesta agrupando a las personas participantes por roles. Este método se basa en hallazgos de evaluaciones de necesidades anteriores a través de las cuales OpenArchive identificó tres roles clave dentro de las comunidades, se encuentran quienes: documentan ( registra y documenta evidencia de primera mano), reciben (supervisa y gestiona la recepción, organización y posible distribución de medios/datos) y con  doble rol (desempeña un papel tanto de documentación como de recepción en su trabajo). Data Cívica y OpenArchive recibieron veinte respuestas a la evaluación de necesidades. La gran mayoria de las  personas encuestadas viven y trabajan en la Ciudad de México. Personas OpenArchive está aprovechando los hallazgos de esta encuesta para mejorar nuestras herramientas y hacerlas más adaptables a las necesidades de Data Cívica. Hemos evaluado cuidadosamente las amenazas, necesidades, capacidades técnicas y flujos de trabajo de archivo actuales a través de la creación de perfiles de usuario y otros métodos de investigación descritos en la metodología de diseño centrada en los derechos humanos (HRCD, por sus siglas en inglés). Esto nos permite obtener una comprensión más profunda de los daños estructurales que experimentan Data Cívica y sus organizaciones aliadas y adaptar nuestras herramientas para garantizar su protección y la de sus contenidos multimedia. Las personas usuarias están modeladas a partir de un individuo o rol particular, pero también incorporan aspectos ficticios que el equipo investigador utiliza para crear arquetipos que describen los patrones de comportamiento, objetivos, habilidades, actitudes, información de antecedentes y el entorno en el que opera el rol. Esta estrategia de HRCD es un enfoque interseccional, exhaustivo y seguro para desarrollar un arquetipo robusto que represente características clave relevantes para el rol.

Our recent needs assessment with Data Cívica offers insight into the realities, challenges, and opportunities faced by activists, journalists, and eyewitnesses in Mexico while documenting and archiving evidence of violence and injustice. This fall, OpenArchive launched our partnership with Data Cívica. Data Cívica employs data and technology to strengthen journalism and civil society in Mexico while fighting genderbased violence, assisting in the search for missing people, documenting and preserving evidence, and increasing transparency and accountability. OpenArchive and Data Cívica completed the research phase of our partnership in October, which mapped the needs, risks, and threats of the communities that are recording, receiving, and amplifying evidence of human rights violations in the country. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists and human rights defenders to operate in. According to Human Rights Watch, journalists and human rights defenders “who criticize public officials or expose the work of criminal cartels often face attacks, harassment, and surveillance by government authorities and criminal groups.” Last year, a journalistic investigation exposed that the military, whose power has expanded in recent years, was using Pegasus spyware to spy on political rivals, journalists, and human rights defenders. Police and the military will also torture detainees to extract information or illicit confessions. Findings from the 2021 Encuesta Nacional de Población Privada de la Libertad, the National Survey of Population Deprived of Liberty, found that nearly half of those surveyed were subjected to physical abuse after arrest. Each year, police, the military, and organized crime groups “disappear” thousands of people in Mexico. As of 2022, 105,000 people are missing. Other key issues in the country include high levels of genderbased violence and femicide, military violence against civilians, and abuses within the criminal justice system, including pretrial detention and poor prison conditions. Many of these violations are hidden or obscured because the government makes it difficult for citizens to share and access public information, thus stymying awareness about them and precluding justice. Due to both the high level of violation and the lack of access to evidence of them, there is a growing need for eyewitnesses and activists to be able to document, verify and share evidence of human rights abuses. Our needs assessment survey yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working to document abuses in Mexico. Threat Landscape and Challenges Survey respondents face both physical and digital threats. Respondents reported risks of physical danger if their identity is exposed, and risks to themselves, their contacts and media if their device is confiscated. They also noted they faced digital security threats like malware, surveillance, and hacking. Digging deeper, respondents whose primary role was documenting human rights abuses, also worried about the strength and security of their internet connection. Respondents who primarily receive, organize, and analyze materials indicated that they also face difficulties accessing and corroborating public information from the government. Meanwhile, survey respondents whose jobs involved both documenting and receiving media added that they struggle to balance security with usability in their methods, which leads to cumbersome workflows. Connectivity and Technical Constraints Internet connectivity is expanding in the country. As of 2021, 76 percent of Mexicans have access to the internet. The 5G mobile network is also expanding, particularly in Mexico City. However, internet access is costly and unevenly available throughout the country, which prevents lowerincome, rural, and Indigenous residents from accessing the internet at the same rate as urban or more affluent residents. Despite increasing access to the internet, there are still barriers to an open online environment. Mexican authorities attempt to influence online narratives through content removal of materials that criticize the government and inauthentic amplification of progovernment content. Additionally, the use of Pegasus spyware to monitor government critics has concerning implications for freedom of expression, association, and assembly. A recent study by the European Parliament examined the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights and democracy. It found that Pegasus spyware had significant impacts on political participation, and “spiedon citizens can feel compelled to abstain from engaging in interactions having political content, from sincerely expressing their views, and from associating with others for political purposes.” Overall, there was a strong preference amongst our survey respondents to connect to the internet using a secure WiFi connection, due to the high cost of cellular data. However, respondents noted that in instances where they could not be sure of a WiFi network's security, they would rather use cellular data than an unsecured WiFi network. Respondents indicated a roughly even split between Android and iPhone users. Lastly, given that survey respondents indicated they had an average technical ability of three on a scale from one to five, there is an opportunity for educational and outreach efforts to strengthen the community’s technical capabilities. Opportunities for Support Personal security and privacy on and offline are top concerns for survey respondents. Despite an interest in privacy tools, 95 percent of respondents did not use encrypted messaging apps to send or receive media.  Many respondents also did not use virtual private networks (VPNs). Additionally, respondents indicated they would benefit from workflow tools that would enhance their ability to archive and preserve media securely without sacrificing privacy or usability. They also were interested in learning more about server options. This is an opportunity for OpenArchive to provide support for training, skill development, and integrating secure archiving tools to better protect them and their media. To this end, in October 2023, OpenArchive held a small trainthetrainer session with Data Cívica staff on best archival practices, technical skills, digital security, and expanding organizational capacity through the Save app. Data Cívica is organizing community workshops in November and December to share this knowledge and train others working to preserve and amplify evidence of injustice. A representative of Data Civíca said, “Civil society organizations, journalists and human rights defenders in México have shown broad interest in learning more about Save. They see it as a priority because of the risks they face daily and their lack of knowledge and time to resolve urgent situations of violations of human rights. Given this, OpenArchive and Data Cívica sharing userfriendly and simple information is incredibly valuable.” Methods OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the receipt, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Data Cívica and OpenArchive received twenty responses to the needs assessment. The vast majority of respondents live and work in Mexico City. User Personas OpenArchive is leveraging the findings from this survey to enhance our tools to be more responsive to Data Cívica’s needs. We have carefully assessed their threats, needs, technical capacities, and current archival workflows through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology. This allows us to gain deeper insight into the structural harms that Data Cívica and its partner organizations experience while working in Mexico and enables us to adapt our tools to better protect them and their media. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, background information, and the environment in which the role operates. This HRCD strategy is an intersectional, thorough, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype representing key characteristics relevant to the role.

By Kelcie Grega and Alex Esenler, September 22nd, 2022 More than 18 months after the military coup in Myanmar that shattered hopes for democratic progress, Myanmar armed forces continue their violence against civilians with arrests, torture massacres, and sexual violence. Members of the country's resistance movement remain nimble as they navigate ways to document and preserve crucial evidentiary media of military atrocities in the face of internet shutdowns, brownouts, and imminent threats of arrest and violence. We talked to three anticoup activists who are working with folks on the ground trying to preserve truth to power. In this post, we'll share strategies the resistance is using to document and fight back against military violence, as well as keep the movement alive. But first, a history lesson The February 2021 coup d'état returned Myanmar to military rule under the socalled Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar. But the push and pull of military power and democratic government structure goes back more than 70 years. Sustaining a movement Myanmar’s postcoup resilience is built on decades of struggle against oppressors: from British imperialism to the current military power. While the country’s liberalization over the past decade systematically excluded ethnic and religious minority groups, protests and resistance efforts since the coup are much more inclusive. Global Voices reported in February 2021 that the General Strike Committee of All Nationalities (GSCN) united 27 of Myanmar's ethnic nationalities, displaying a show of unity against a common enemy. Duwa Lashi La, a lawyer, and politician who serves as the acting president of the National Unity Government (Myanmar’s government in exile composed of lawmakers and those elected in the 2020 elections) told The Diplomat in July that integrating Ethnic Resistance Organizations (EROs) has helped the prodemocracy resistance maintain territories in the Chin State, Sagaing, and Magwe regions. “Despite the challenges, I have never seen a more promising time for our people to find common ground and establish a genuine federal union together,” Duwa Lashi La, who himself is of Kachin descent, told The Diplomat. An independent researcher who studies digital activism in Myanmar, referred to here by the pseudonym Joseph, says what also sets this latest movement apart from past resistance efforts is that it’s being led by a much younger generation, armed with smartphones and a new sense of digital literacy. This new generation of resistance fighters already experienced life under a liberal democracy, meanwhile their older counterparts aren’t ready to go back to the way things were, he says. “They’ve already enjoyed a taste of freedom.” Staying safe while on the ground Ma Sabai – who asked to be referred to by this pseudonym – was in Yangon when the Spring Revolution erupted in early 2021. Her home was home just blocks away from daily protests and actions. Before the coup, Ma Sabai was already an active part of prodemocracy circles, educating her community on democratization, federalism and Myanmar’s constitutional process. When the military junta took over in Feb. 2021, she along with fellow resistance fighters took to the streets and documented both the protests and military violence on civilians. Young people in particular were targeted in mass arrests, torture and killings, according to Radio Free Asia. At sundown, Ma Sabai would bang pots and pans with her neighbors to protest the military power. “[The military] did not like that. They tried to hit us and shoot us with tear gas and they tried to arrest people,” she says. When security forces attempted to “disperse” the crowds, Ma Sabai said she would run to shelter. Some civilians who lived close to the action, including her brother, allowed protesters to take refuge in their homes. Once she and fellow resistance fighters found a safe place, they would hide all tools and pamphlets related to the revolution and quickly change their clothes so they couldn’t be recognized or tracked. Staying anonymous while supporting a cause In Myanmar, anyone who so much as “likes” prodemocracy and resistance content on social media can face up to 10 years in prison. Ma Sabai says she keeps multiple Facebook profiles with different names to keep her identity safe. She also never posts or interacts with resistance content on her personal social media accounts. When leaving the house, Ma Sabi says she deletes all social media apps and VPNs from her devices. Now, almost two years since protests erupted in Myanmar, the military is refocusing efforts toward cracking down on other forms of dissent like donating to revolutionary causes. A lawyer, who requested to remain anonymous as they advise ontheground activists in Myanmar on how to stay safe while documenting social unrest and human rights abuses, shared with us some strategies people use to mitigate risks. Average civilians who want to donate to or support organizations like the People’s Defense Force (PDF) – the revolutionary group fighting against the military junta – often have to take extra steps to protect themselves, according to the lawyer. One way is to label donations online with something innocuous. People donating from outside the country have to go through multiple layers of bank accounts to make it harder for the ruling regime to track transactions. Navigating digital security under state surveillance With the threat of military surveillance omnipresent, it becomes crucial to ensure those capturing military violence and coordinating, participating in, and documenting prodemocracy movements know how to keep themselves digitally secure. It’s vital to only share sensitive organizing information on endtoend messaging platforms like Signal and Telegram. “We also started giving ourselves aliases and different names, so that they will not be able to track us,” the lawyer says. For communication via email, the lawyer encouraged others to start using ProtonMail, which also provides security through endtoend encryption. Getting people to adopt more secure tools and messaging platforms hasn’t been easy, the lawyer says. For many people in Myanmar, Facebook is esentially the internet, and often acts as the primary organizing tool for civil disobedience campaigns, labor strikes, and other actions. After recognizing the power of smartphones in resistance efforts, the junta began implementing random checkpoints and searches on civilians’ phones. Both the lawyer and Ma Sabai say activists, eyewitnesses, and documentarians often keep multiple phones; one for personal use, and one for documenting protests and military violence. “If they find any content related to the revolution, you can be arrested and jailed,” the lawyer says. When Ma Sabai was documenting protests in 2021, she uploaded crucial evidence of military violence onto a cloud service before deleting it on her phone. Sometimes she would store files in a folder labeled with an inconspicuous name before military authorities had the chance to search her device. For the lawyer – who is currently based in the U.S. – encouraging digital security practices is a matter of life and death. “I have to really make sure that my family is safe back home because if you're outside of the country, they come after your family,” he says. Controlling the narrative The the anticoup resistance is fought both on the ground and online, with civilians controlling the narrative through hashtags like #WhatshappeninginMyanmar and publicly shaming military supporters online. While good for the revolution, social media is also used as a tool by the military to fight back against the resistance, Joseph says. When military leaders seized power, internet providers in Myanmar were ordered to ban Facebook (Meta)owned services in the country, including Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. The demand for virtual private networks (VPNs) surged in the country, but the lawyer says the junta is currently seeking a ban on VPNs. Military authorities also use social media to disseminate junta propaganda. Radio Free Asia reported in March that military authorities often use Telegram to collect intelligence on prodemocracy celebrities, antijunta activists, and journalists. Activists told RFA that the military uses this information to crack down on antijunta actions across the country. In August, Tatmadaw spokesman MajorGeneral Zaw Min Tun announced that the regime plans to replace Facebook with its own homegrown social media platform. “It’s kind of scary,” Joseph says. “If they start doing that and contain [social media communications] there is no way to escape.” Keep up with #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar The situation in Myanmar is constantly changing and evolving.

OpenArchive, an organization dedicated to advancing freedom of digital expression, announced today the release of a new mobile application, Save, that safeguards digital evidence of human rights abuses around the world. As police violently crack down on peaceful protests, social media companies censor evidence of war crimes, national telecom services are suspended in times of unrest, and governments seek to suppress documentary evidence of atrocities, witnesses capturing media on mobile phones play a key role in exposing injustice during turbulent times around the world. Save makes it easy for journalists, activists, lawyers and others to safely store, share, preserve and amplify documentation of human rights injustices without fear of censorship, surveillance or retribution. Our Save app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed. \"Organizations with distributed teams face challenges in aggregating, indexing and cataloging their communities' digitallycaptured content into particular workflows, often in and from dangerous locations\", says Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive and a fellow at the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab. For Cadranel and organizations she works with such as Human Rights Watch, Save's success will be measured in what the tool can provide to human rights defenders; the app’s inception was a direct response to mounting efforts worldwide to suppress dissent through police crackdowns on peaceful protests, censorship by governments and social media companies, telecom service shutdowns, and other forms of retaliation. Unlike existing mediasharing tools, Save offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input, our commitment to digital inclusion, and iterative design. Key features include Ease of Use: userdriven, intuitive design based on community feedback throughout the toolbuilding process; Source Protection: TLS and Orbot/Tor for Android (iOS coming soon) prevent interception and surveillance; Media Verification: via hashing and Proofmode for Android (iOS coming soon), which adds sensor data to corroborate metadata captured with the media; Simplified Media Workflows: seamlessly organize media from many phones on your server into organized folders; Media Flagging: flag media as “significant” so reviewers are prepared for what they will see or as a way to \"favorite\" media; Batch Editing: update the metadata/flags of multiple media files at once; Importing from Other Apps: share media from other apps on your phone, such as audio/notes/pdfs. While those using Save can store their mobile media at the Internet Archive, they can also integrate the app into their existing serverside preservation architecture. This provides securityminded individuals and teams with a responsible, innovative “off the shelf” frontend solution for ethically collecting and curating their media from around the world. Whether hosted on individual servers or integrated with an organization's existing technical infrastructure, Save is engineered to create robust protection of and redundancy for mobilecaptured media content. Unlike most of today's major media platforms, Save values human rights over corporate profits. By streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting, it shifts power into the hands of those on the front lines. This means that the information sent through it cannot be censored, blocked or arbitrarily deleted. Our Save app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed. The Save app fills a longstanding need to provide secure, fully encrypted and selfhosted file transfer for our staff all over the world,\" says Nicole Martin, Senior Manager of Archives and Digital Systems at Human Rights Watch. \"OpenArchive carefully listened to our needs, built an intuitive app, and tailored its features to make human rights data safer, and my job a whole lot easier. With support from public interest advocates, a team of open source developers, human rights archivists and ethnographers, digital security experts, journalists, and international civil society members incorporated extensive community input while creating Save.","news/save-security-audit":"title: OTF & Trail of Bits’ Independent Security Audit of Savedescription: Through support from the Open Tech Fund's (OTF) Red Team Lab, OpenArchive successfully completed a thirdparty security audit conducted by Trail of Bits.date: 07/31/23category: Newsimage: savesecurityaudit.png OTF & Trail of Bits’ Independent Security Audit of Save Through support from the Open Tech Fund's (OTF) Red Team Lab, OpenArchive successfully completed a thirdparty security audit conducted by Trail of Bits.

Enter Save. Designed with extensive community input, the app shifts power into the hands of those on the frontlines by streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting. With Save, you can now safely share, archive, verify, and encrypt your media without fear of censorship, surveillance, or retribution. Share Upload your verified media to your own secure server such as Nextcloud, Internet Archive, or DropBox. Communicate your intentions for future use by adding a Creative Commons license, allowing others to reuse or remix it. Archive Keep your media safe and organized for the longterm by saving multiple copies on noncommercial secure servers. Create inapp project folders that map to your personal or organizational media archive. Verify Authenticate and verify your media with sha256 hashes and optional ProofMode. Capture and include critical metadata like notes, people, and location with each upload. Encrypt Automatically upload over TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect your media in transit. To further enhance security, install Orbot (a.k.a Tor for mobile) to prevent interception of your media while it travels from your phone to its destination. Who we serve We designed Save with and for human rights defenders worldwide, including: Human rights organizations collecting evidence of human rights violations Archivists and librarians creating community collections at the Internet Archive or other digital libraries Journalists and news organizations receiving sensitive information from vulnerable sources whose identity and information must be protected from interception Individuals, freelance documentarians, and citizen journalists curating their own mobile media collections Academic organizations accepting targeted media from the field Core features Unlike other mediasharing tools, Save offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion. Authenticate media With Save, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media. Secure transit Save always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure intransit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice. Longterm Preservation When you use Save to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to longterm media preservation.
